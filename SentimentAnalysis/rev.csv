0,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,6," Not what I expected...:I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies."
1,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,8," I liked it a lot:Phase 4's MCU comes to a close with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.I think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.It's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect. With good action, a solid story, a very good new antagonist (Namor and the whole underworld were great), and fantastic music (maybe the best Marvel score so far?), this was a very good MCU movie, and gives me a little more hope for the franchise going forward."
2,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,6," I Yield:First of all, RIP to Chadwick Boseman. They really did do a good tribute to him in this movie through various devices. Performances when reflecting his death felt real and convincing, probably because there was little ""acting"" involved. Losing a franchise star is really a tough blow. While I felt Boseman's absence, I don't think not all of the movie's downfalls are linked to his absence.Biggest head-scratching moments were for me was poor writing mainly from some of the tactical choices. The whole conflict stems from the existence of Riri (soon to be Ironheart), who built a Vibranium detector for a school project. Apparently, she's the only one in the world who can do that. Aside from that ridiculous premise, I thought Ironheart's introduction to the MCU was not bad (I still think the suit is ugly). She was likable enough and I think she has potential. I do worry about the overlap between her and Shuri because while they do have good chemistry, they are such similar characters. Anyways, this detector triggers a cascade of events where Shuri and Riri are taken to Talokan. First of all, getting rid of Riri will not do anything because the technology is no longer in her hands alone. Also, Wakandans have very little reason to protect her other than the fact she's a great scientist. I was also baffled that key hostages like Shuri and Riri could escape Taloka with the help of one person DURING an ongoing negotiation. A rookie foreign affairs mistake. It was not even a hostage situation. It was closer to an aggressive invitation. This was literally the cause of the all-out war and I thought it was just poorly written how they started that conflict. And at that point, the entire war felt so meaningless and stakeless because it wasn't clear why they were fighting. It still isn't clear why Talokans wanted to go to war with Wakanda. So whatever came after that became difficult to love. Ramonda's death was also quite preventable in my opinion. The queen with no protection and left to drown. Like why does Riri matter so much to Ramonda that she sacrificed herself to save her? It almost felt like an artificial plot device to pump up Ironheart's value as a a character. And Shuri does not blame Riri once or show any animosity toward her even though she was an indirect cause of her mother's death? Seemed a little strange unless she didn't know what happened.There were positive things too. I thought Taloka's story was interesting and was well introduced. Loved Namor as a character and his action scenes were powerful enough. The performances were solid across the board, especially Ramonda and Namor shined. I thought some of the battle sequences were interesting despite being imperfect (really bad CG moments here and there). Overall, it was rather inconsistent with really cool spear fighting scenes and just generic scenes. The whales really did surprise me. I thought the locations were well chosen. I really like their portrayal of Wakanda and Taloka in general so that's a plus. I enjoyed how they incorporated the idea of the oppressed (the Mayans) versus oppressor like they did in Black Panther 1. But again, this should only unite Taloka and Wakanda together rather than fight against each other.I'd also like to comment on Shuri. She has now become the official franchise star with the death of Ramonda and T'challa. My overall impression that while she has the potential to be the franchise but it's a tough transition. She's been known as the geek scientist sister but now she's the black panther and the sole protector of Wakanda. That's a big jump for both the audience and the character. That type of transition, fueled mostly by grief and revenge, should usually take multiple movies or a series to hash out but that was not an option for the production team. So while I still am not used to the transition, I think they were handled as well as they could be. Her characterization was complex and meaningful enough. A far better experience than the most recent MCU movie.In the end, phase 4 has been a let-down for most fans with a notable exception. I was disappointed that this movie was not able to be part of that exception."
3,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,9," A Fantastic  Emotional  and Mature Marvel Film:Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.Some people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.With all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film? Also, the final scene that takes place during the credits is easily one of my favourite post-credit scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very well handled. Now playing in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
4,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,8," Pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence:""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the sequel to 2018's ""Black Panther"" and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"", ""Creed""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.After the unfortunate passing of ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.Anybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.I think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.Due to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.This film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.Out of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.Though I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances. I know I would be.I rate it 8/10."
5,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,6," Overblown and Oversaturated Airplane Movie:At this point, Marvel is getting too saturated for its own good. The movie's beginning and the end is good, but the middle is too slow and crammed with corporate-mandated plot requirements, so much so that the writers didn't know what to do.I really feel that this is the product of unrealistic corporate deadlines, leading to incohesive and plot-hole ridden story, subpar CGI, and morally problematic characters that we are supposed to think are heroes. I don't think Marvel is really taking the time to quality check.To start, the villain is not really likeable or unlikeable. The villain just sort of exists. At least the first Black Panther movie had a villain that was likeable, carried by the performance of Michael B. Jordan. Another point of weakness is how Ironheart was crammed into the plot as required by Disney. As they tried to cram her in, plot points began to crack (which will not be mentioned here due to spoilers). The story is not cohesive. The third, and perhaps the biggest, point of weakness is the action scenes.Action scenes, you would think, would be the centerpieces of superhero movies, right? But Marvel's sweat-shop CGI studios seem to lack the motivation or at least the time to render quality products, not to mention how the choreography is sub-par as well. At the end, Black Panther 2's action scenes are forgettable.It is mildly entertaining enough to be an airplane or a steam-at-home movie, but this is by no means a great movie."
6,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,," Bad editing ruined it; the stellar score and wardrobe couldn't save it:This film and its prequel both had exceptional visual design, particularly in the diverse wardrobe styles displayed, and throught-provoking instrumentation in the score. The score was particularly captivating this time around. But none of this could save the film from its pacing, clarity and consistency issues.Even if we forget the outright errors (where the audio didn't match the visuals), the film just had a lot of awkward silence, like the actors were expecting quick cuts and were just waiting for direction. There were hundreds of places I would have cut a second here, two seconds there, enough not only to bring some energy into the pacing, but also to buy more time to understand Namor's people. Little time is spent really getting to empathize with them. Even Namor's story lacked clarity and fleshing out.More than 90 minutes in, the story finally started to get interesting, with noteworthily well-done action sequences. But even then, it was painfully obvious that some sequences where done by entirely different teams, with completely inconsistent tonality. So it was hard to enjoy the good parts, with how different they were from the rest.I admit I had high hopes for the final film of Phase 4, but this just didn't deliver."
7,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,8," A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!:I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win."
8,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,7," Not the Black Panther we were promised:The movie is fine overall but it's so very long.The story takes ages to go anywhere but the scenes move way too quickly into the next ones.Namor was a great villain with a really interesting change and served to be the highlight of the film but it wasn't quite enough to save it and keep me invested.It did feel at times like a beautiful goodbye to Chadwick Bozeman but it often seemed to forget that it's a movie too.It also never really answers why the FBI are after Riri Williams (Iron Heart) they just show up and it kind of felt like they just wanted more involvement for Martin Freeman and Julia Louis Dreyfus than any practical, story telling reasons.All-in-all, better than the Disney+ projects but not the film we needed to save the MCU."
9,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,10," Extremely Emotional Movie About Loss  Legacy And Healing!:""Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4. I can not understate how masterful the score is from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film. And Tenoch Huerta? They couldn't have found a better Namor.""Ryan Coogler's emotional movies is about loss, legacy and healing. The story is intimate, but vast with global power struggles and palace intrigue. Tenoch Huerta's Namor is a force, better than I hoped. So much can be told...The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! Fantastic sequel and a great movie. I knew it'd be emotional and it was. Expect your eyes to leak.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!"
10,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,7," Unlikely to make the same impact as the original  Wakanda Forever is a mature and effective Marvel outing:A cultural phenomenon that was the rare type of film that struck a chord with critics, audiences, box office booths and the awards circuits, 2018's Black Panther was one of the most resounding success stories of the Marvel cinematic universe, with it always going to be a tough task for returning director Ryan Coogler to strike the same gold he did with his beloved first foray into the Marvel world.The task Coogler and his creative partners faced was made all the monumental by the tragic and shattering passing of T'Challa/Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, the type of heartbreaking real life loss the Marvel world has never had to overcome before in this way but against all the odds Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in somehow working with the passing of Boseman to make a cohesive film, that may not be ground-breaking, but offers up a very different type of Marvel film that is centred and driven by grief both imagined and real.Undoubtedly an entirely different film than the one that was first being developed by Coogler, Forever wastes little time dealing with T'Challa's demise and all of the films sombre moments of respect and consideration for the life of both the character and Boseman in turn is handled with aplomb here and when moving through the films (sadly overlong) 160 minute runtime, it's not too see and feel that this is an entirely different type of Marvel exercise that thankfully places the off-kilter comedic focussed mode it's been operating in since the early Guardians and Thor: Ragnarok days to deliver a more mature offering that's fairly likely to not win over the younger fans that have made Marvel their own over the last decade.With Boseman and T'Challa no longer the central focus of the Black Panther universe, much extra weight has been added onto the likes of Letitia Wright's Shuri, Angela Bassett's Ramonda, Winston Duke's M'Baku and Danai Gurira's Okoye, with all returning players once more delivering the goods for Coogler on the acting front with Wright in particular impressing with a character that is now largely far removed from the one we initially saw in the original.As is usually the case with a Marvel outing some of the best moments in Forever stem from the new players with Dominique Thorne's feisty and gung-ho Riri likely to be a new fan favourite (even if her role here is slightly forced) while Tenoch Huerta's new adversary Namor is one of the more effective ""villains"" Marvel has introduced in the cinematic landscape since the full reveal of Thanos many moons ago.Mostly recognisable from some TV work and mid-tier feature films, Huerta's take on the underwater dwelling Namor is a massive win for the film and much like Killmonger in the 2018 outing, his performance and character arc provides much weight to a film that without him may have felt like a lesser event, with motivations one can understand up to a point and enough development and growth where we can see so much potential both good and bad, Huerta and in turn Namor make us wish for more exploration of a whole new kingdom of Marvel that is hopefully explored even more than it is successfully but briefly looked at here.Another element of Forever that must be made note of and celebrated is the work of composer Ludwig Göransson who creates one of the most unique and noticeably effective Marvel scores we've yet encountered and while his work in the first film and other recent outings such as Tenet and The Mandalorian TV series showcase a talented artist at work, this is the type of score that heralds in the official arrival of a composer that could be about to shake the industry up in all the right ways.With a lot of elements to enjoy, Forever is unlikely to have the same type of impact either culturally or narratively as the first outing did and there will be some that find Coogler's close to three hour epic overly long in the tooth with a sagging middle section the most notable instance of running through the motions, while some side characters that appear set to play bigger parts merely come and go when it pleases the story, with the film at its best when it allows the likes of Shuri and Namor the time they deserve in the spotlight, especially without an Avenger or an unnecessary cameo in sightFinal Say -Considering the odds stacked against it, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is without question another success story for Marvel but not everything pays off in Coogler's high-reaching outing that overstays its welcome at times and may find itself fairly/unfairly judged against an original it's not going to match for impact or sentiment.3 1/2 wing feet out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
11,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,10," The Beautifully Crafted Film Is Heart Wrenching  But Showcases The Power Of Identity  Culture  Family And Pride:The beautifully crafted film, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is heart wrenching, but also showcases the power of identity, culture, family and pride. The costumes are intricate and gorgeous; the music is moving; and the acting is just spectacular. I felt captivated during every moment of the film, and the nearly realistic world of Wakanda made me feel like I was there myself, even though it is futuristic and fictional.The storyline follows Princess Shuri (Letita Wright) and the Wakandan army as they fight to protect Wakanda from a new force that threatens to attack their home. After the heartbreaking passing of King T'Challah (Chadwick Boseman), Shuri and her mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are left with the weight of the country on their shoulders. They must band together with Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), General Okoye (Danai Gurira), and young scientist Riri (Domonique Thorne) as they constantly battle to save the only home they know from an otherworldly army, which threatens the secrets of Wakanda's renowned Vibranium. Will they win this excruciating battle, or will Wakanda fall?Letita Wright, as the protagonist, Princess Shuri, performs beautifully. Her acting choices and authentic emotion are captivating. While this film is dark and somber, there is still enough comedy to keep you chuckling, just at the moment when a little happiness feels most necessary. The music in this film is perfectly aligned with every sequence in the story - powerful in battle scenes; sorrowful at moments of loss; and uplifting in moments of triumph. Without the music, viewers would not be so easily transported into Marvel's Wakandan world. The intricate and bedazzled costuming is gorgeous, displaying the marvelous variety of design from diverse cultures around the world. And last, but most certainly not least, the visual effects and CGI are spectacular. The beauty of Wakanda's futuristic world and technology is so real that you can almost touch it.There are many messages in this film, but two stand out to me the most. First, always trust your heart; it will lead you in the right direction no matter how many paths there are to stray from. Second, no one is ever truly gone, they will live for as long as their memory lives inside you. These messages are uplifting for everyone who needs comfort. Although there is violence in this movie, there is not much gore. The use of a variety of weapons makes this film more appropriate for older children and teens.I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. By Nyara A., KIDS FIRST!"
12,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,6," Empty:Obviously this movie is a huge thing. Chadwick is a legend and will always be seen as the black panther. This movie was just so filler and boring with a pace that's way too slow for a 2 hour+ film. It's not a bad film it's just a long slog of a movie. Nothing big happens in the movie at all apart from the mantle passing of black panther, it's very empty. Compared to the first black panther it's a completely different tone and pace to it which wouldn't be a bad thing if the story was engaging. Shuri becoming the new black panther I expected due to comic knowledge and I'm happy with that and I thought her story was decent along with showing her dark side especially in her fight with Namor. All the performances were great and I liked Riri Williams as an addition to the MCU, whilst some of her scenes were stale and the suit looked like trash I'll stay open minded for her show. Namor was okay, he was cool to watch. Namor and his people let the story down as it was built up to be this huge war but ultimately led to nothing but boring and ugly fight scenes between everyone and this was in the whole movie too! Namor was interesting just a poorly written character mostly which was unfortunate. The post credit scenes were underwhelming and they did a fast and furious by naming a child after the character/person that died which was fine I guess but unnecessary. The comedy was great though even though it lacked which is what made it rewarding when it happened. The scenes honouring Chadwick were fantastic though leaving me to tear up with how connected I was along with the world to this person and character. Those scenes were special. Also the film ended the same as it started with empty threats of war between the two groups leaving no hype for the future and the overwhelming feeling of being unrewarding. Overall Black Panther Wakanda Forever pays a beautiful and emotional tribute to Chadwick but lacks heavily in a well written or engaging story."
13,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,3," Very weak and mediocre movie:We have reached a point at which people will watch anything that has the tag ""Marvel"" on it. I kept fighting to prevent myself from falling asleep during the first hour. It's incredibly slow and nothing interesting happens. Namor and Talokans could be terrifying but couldn't reach their full potential.The forced jokes weren't funny at all. The action sequences doesn't look good. The background tracks/scores were too much or had no control. It stood seperate from what's happening.I can understand why they should be grieving but grief isn't so good for a marvel movie. They didn't handle it well either. The wow factor is missing and the whole movie falls flat."
14,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,," Well... it's not what I expected:Saw this the other night at the movies. The cinema was packed with joyous Marvel fans who have obviously enjoyed the first Black Panther movie. The first 30 minutes into the movie, the audience vibes cooled off noticeably. After 2h41, most people stood up and quickly left the theater, more than half of the crowd not even caring for the end credit scene. Well, that tells you something...After the screening, our group of four discussed what disappointed the most: was it the dragging narrative (trying to tell too many stories and trying to pleasing too many audiences), the lengthy dialogues (which to me felt like they made up 2/3 of this movie), the rushed/forced action scenes or (what bothered me the most) the absence of the Black Panther for most of the running time. In the end, the movie disappoints on many levels."
15,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,9," A Fitting Tribute:At the risk of overstatement, it's hard not to be blown away by writer-director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has. Wakanda Forever indeed."
16,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,9," Tender  human  tragic and Beautiful:The biggest compliment I can give this film is just how human it feels, you can feel the grief and sadness pouring through every shot. But perhaps the best part of this movie is the grief isn't used to make it good the story is compelling, Namor is a great villain and Shuris arc in the course of this movie was amazing and some of marvels best character arc. Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan (sorry if misspelled) was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy. But aside from that this has to be one of the better marvel movies and worthy successor to the original black panther."
17,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,6," It's fine  I guess?:First off, it's long. There's minimal action. The action there is is disappointing. So we have a fairly boring movie. I get the intention to focus on the emotional notes in the wake of CB's death, but it just didn't hit me in my feels. My husband cried. A lot. I remain unmoved. The visuals appear very muted when compared to first movie. Bizarre inclusion of naming conventions/explanations à la Solo movie. We get even more characters getting nano suits. Really? I know it's hard to come up with new ideas, but we've seen more than enough of these at this point.As I said, it's fine. I guess. Definitely didn't hate it."
18,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,10," Perfect tribute to Chadwick Boseman !:This movie is emotional in terms of its storyline and we know why.I love this movie.The themes in this movie of grief, revenge, legacy, and family were astounding and handled very well. It has dark theme which I liked the most.The cinematography was incredible along with the costume design and soundtrack. The CGI was really well done.I definitely recommend seeing this in theatres if you can, I know that I'm going to be making more trips back to see it a few more times. All I have to say now is - Rest in Peace Chadwick Boseman... your legacy will always be with us.MUST WATCH for a MARVEL Fan !!"
19,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,7," For Honor  For Legacy  For Wakanda!:The first black panther was mostly focused on Wakandan affairs, this one really expands that but despite the wider scope it is one of the most intimate movies in the MCU so far. Less action and more about honoring Black Panther's death, if felt more real considering Chadwick himself passed; it was also more political handling the passing of power and as I did my best to avoid spoilers and teaser trailers, I've found out the big secret was already revealed in a leak. I'll try avoiding the spoilers.As said earlier, this one doesn't not only like focus on wakanda, it widens it's scope to the whole world. It increases the stakes, making it seem like an elaborate plot scheme. I loved that it was evenly matched throughout, Wakanda seemed to have better tech but Talocans seemed to be stronger fighters.Namor had a really cool, mysterious intro. M'baku was hilarious, the movie was generally quite comedic for the first half but unlike other recent marvel movies it fortunately wasn't forced humor. Action felt seldom especially considering the runtime, but after watching the first black panther just before they were better. It's slow paced so this isn't as blood rushing as other marvel movies, don't expect constant tension or fights. Everyone was as good as you'd expect but Angela Bassett gave an amazing performance and stood out. As was the first movie, I still feel like Andy Serkis is an underrated perfect casting.Opening scene honors T'challa and opening credits for Chadwick, it's continued throughout. It had flashbacks and tributes that made the movie more of a farewell to both, everything seemed secondary.I watched this as a double feature with the first back to back and Wakanda Forever is better. I didn't really have high expectations as a lot of Phase 4 productions have disappointed me, and some of the projects that I actually liked were met with criticisms.End Game carried a lot of emotions a closure to Phase three, this has to be the most devotedly emotional in depth marvel movie, not because of the fan love but because it was written that way. Might not be the best at it but for a superhero movie it was. It was a great way to honor Chadwick and a good movie, I however didn't get that feeling leaving the cinema like I had just seen something special. You know, the way you felt after endgame, even though that's a high bar. The movie still does an impressive job and difficult task bettering it's prequel without it's beloved star, delivering the most emotional take in the MCU thus far."
20,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,9," Women of Will and Worth:Immediately prominent in this sequel are the strong stories given to its cast of talented black actresses. Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia all give powerful performances as their roles were expanded from the original movie. Two new actresses joined their ranks -- Michaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as Riri, both stepping up in their hero game.The new anti-hero Namor is played by charismatic Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta. The film gave him the full backstory dating back to the 16th century, telling the origin of his incredible abilities, and even how he got his name. Even if Namor was the main antagonist of the film, Huerta played him as a passionate protector of his undersea city of Talokan and the Vibranium that sustained it. His comics name Submariner has yet to come up.Director Ryan Coogler's production design, costume design and hair and makeup teams outdid themselves in this sequel as they did not only designed Wakanda, but also Talokan. In the comics, Namor's underwater kingdom was called Atlantis, inspired by Greek mythology. However in this new film, Atlantis was given a decidedly Mesoamerican civilzation, from its architecture, costumes, language and culture.Even though lead actor and original Black Panther Chadwick Boseman had already passed away two years, Marvel made this sequel a beautiful tribute to his memory. From the specially altered opening credits all the way up to the emotionally-rich mid-credits scene, and all the scenes in between with lines that looked back on the life and extolled the nobility of T'Challa, Boseman was still very much part of this new film."
21,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,6," Namor was great - should have been his movie:Wakanda Forever tells the story of how Wakanda got a new Black Panther in a war with the Atlantis (or whoever they were). The film's best parts are the underwater beings who attack Wakanda. Prince Namor is really cool and the actor who plays him has great screen presence. His underwater people are a lot of fun to see in action.The film's big problem is that the lead is insufferable and annoying. She doesn't have a lot of screen charisma, makes a much better sidekick than a main protagonist, and overall it's not that interesting that she ever becomes Black Panther. You never really root for her I this film.Also, this film is mostly boring acting and writing repeating information we already know and everyone being depressed all the time. It's hard to get into a movie that is two hours and forty minutes of this.Probably, it should have just been called Namor and have Wakanda be the side characters."
22,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,10," A tribute:The center of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever""-the sequel to the hugely popular ""Black Panther,"" and a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman-is sincere, even if the overall film feels manufactured. It begins with a funeral for the recently deceased King T'Challa. Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are dressed in white, following the black coffin, whose top features a silver emblem of the Black Panther mask and the crossed arms of the Wakanda salute. Their mournful procession, winding through the kingdom, is contrasted with slow-motion tracking shots of dancers jubilantly dancing in memory of their fallen king. After the coffin arrives at a clearing, where it ceremoniously rises to the sky, we cut to an earnest, emotional montage of Boseman as T'Challa. The solemn, aching continuum of images soon forms the ""Marvel Studios"" logo, announcing that this is still a Marvel movie. And ""Wakanda Forever"" is all the worst for it. But writer/director Ryan Coogler and his co-writer Joe Robert Cole don't possess the same kind of freedom with this melancholy sequel. Some limitations aren't within their control, such as the tragic death of Boseman. The hulking script is chock-full of ideas and themes. Rather than fighting their common enemy (white colonists), two kingdoms helmed by people of color are pitted against each other (an idea that never thematically lands), and the film must delve into the cultural pain that still exists from the historical annihilation of Central and South America's Indigenous kingdoms. A major sea battle ensues, new, ropey gadgets are employed, and loose ends are inarticulately tied. Another montage dedicated to Boseman occurs, and while the film is messy, you're relieved that it begins and ends on the right foot. That is, until the saccharine post-credit scene. I'm not sure what Coogler was thinking. He had more weight on him for this movie than any filmmaker deserves. But when this scene occurred, I audibly groaned at what amounts to a weepy, treacly moment that's wholly unnecessary, emotionally manipulative, and partially unearned. It's one of the many instances where ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" might have its heart in the right place but is in the wrong mindset and in the worst space-at the center of a contrived cinematic universe-to mourn on its own terms."
23,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,7," Namor the merrier.:Hmm.... I think maybe the problem is me. I need to stop going to see Marvel movies expecting them to change my life as when, like ""Wakanda Forever"", they're just fine, I come away feeling underwhelmed.With King T'Challa succumbing to a mystery illness, his younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) struggles with the guilt of being unable to save him. With no Black Panther to defend Wakanda, other countries take the opportunity to try and get their hands on Vibranium deposits. After Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) makes it clear that they will not be parting with any, the US discovers another source, deep in the Atlantic Ocean. Their discovery brings them into contact with an undersea Kingdom led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia), an empire whose use of the mineral makes them a formidable opponent.One of ""Wakanda Forever's"" real problems also provides its most meaningful moments. It is a film about grief, and what people should take from it. The early funeral of King T'Challa, as well as seeing murals of Chadwick Boseman on buildings is genuinely moving - and that is not to even speak of the films one post credits scene. I can't imagine what it was like for the cast to film those various scenes. But it hurts the overall plot of the film. We've just done overwhelming grief with Wanda and it feels like a bit of a redux to do it again here. It's not the only failure of the plot too, Namor is a great character and it's interesting to see him and his world and its painfully obvious that this is going to be the last time they use him, which hamstrings the resolution of the film. I appreciate that a criticism of the MCU has been too reliant on comedy recently but here, for obvious tonal reasons, its desperately lacking.But it's not a bad film. The other great criticism of the MCU recently has been poor visual effects - that is certainly not the case here as Coogler has created another visually stunning film. It's probably lacking one major action scene, but the ones that are present are pretty good. It introduces or rejigs a number of characters that will pay into the MCU for the forthcoming years.I liked it and I thought it was good, but I want to love these films and I'm afraid that again, I couldn't quite get there."
24,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,5," Talocan forever!:Enough has been said by other reviewers about the film's overall weaknesses - it's overlong, meandering and drags in many places. Instead, I want to focus on a question no one else seems to be asking: what is up with these Wakandans?I was a definite fan of the first movie, but as the sequel progressed, I found myself more and more annoyed (and irritated) by the film's semi-religious Wakandaphilia. Frankly, the constant self-adulation and smug sense of exceptionalism displayed by every Wakandan character really started to grate. After a while, what I'm sure the film-makers see as a message of empowerment starts to sound a lot like fascistic aggrandizement. If this degree of messianic self-love were displayed by characters in any other (real) country, it would be dismissed as overblown nationalism.Let's not forget, as the film itself points out, Wakanda is a superpower - possibly the most powerful nation on earth, thanks to its stocks of 'vibranium' - so it's difficult to swallow the idea that they are also somehow persecuted victims. Add to this the fact that they jealously try to preserve their monopoly of this most valuable resource, and its associated technology, and its hard not to see Wakanda as just another arrogant and self-interested power.Indeed, after a while, my sympathies shifted much more to the rival Talocans, who with some justification came to see Wakanda as more of a threat than an ally. Maybe the next movie could be called Talocan Forever, and show their side of the story instead."
25,Black Adam,8," Black Adam Is Not Perfect But It's Still Great  It's Still Fun  It's Still Fascinating  It's Still Exciting  And I Enjoy The Hell Out Of It:Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it."
26,Black Adam,3," Laughably bad:Was this script the result of a 5th grade class project?It starts with some of the weakest, most contrived world-building I've seen. Moves to some appalling acting, from various children and bad guys especially. This gets compounded by some of the worst dialogue since George Lucas last wrote a screenplay.And it just continues to get worse from there.Now I usually enjoy the dumbest nonsense that Dwayne Johnson stars in. Even Skyscraper, Rampage & San Andreas were watchable, despite being dreadful movies. But there is no saving this one.This latest poor effort from DC makes the most braindead Fast & Furious entry look like Shakespeare.Looking at the director's previous credits it should come as no surprise that this movie is just plain bad."
27,Black Adam,4," Disappointing:I hoped ""Black Adam"" would be a decent entry in DC's recent output as its linked with ""Shazam"" which might be their best recent movie. But nope. Its another CGI filled dud.On the plus side there is an effort put into the story and Dwayne Johnson and his rediculusly strong shoulders buldging from his costume are 100 percent real amongst all the boring CGI. But all the team building with rubbish characters no one cares about has already been DC's downfall with the justice league, Suicide squad and even that Harley Quinn movie. And it's takes up too much time here too.There's not enough time dedicated to making us care about any of these minor characters and their random powers. Just action, action, action that doesn't matter when you don't care about anyone in the movie.There's some decent gags in the movie I suppose. But overall its just alot of green screen and feels like your watching a computer game instead of a movie. It's more ""Aquaman"" than ""Shazam."" So if you liked that one you'll probably like this."
28,Black Adam,4," what was the point:Is there ever gonna be a character arc? Terrible cuts, terrible action, terrible acting, terrible plot. Unlikable characters (they made the Rock unlikable!) is not a fun time.Not sure its wise to introduce new characters with no idea who they are or what is their motivations. Didn't all those bad Suicide Squad/Harley Quinn/Joker films tell us that?Rock looks good but old. Is this a one off for the character or do they weave him into the DC Uni. I guess so since Superman showed up.This is a kid's movie, with kid's plotting, very much a wasted movie.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16."
29,Black Adam,7," If Michael Bay & Zack Snyder had a baby:Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.And guess what? It works. Mostly.Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing ""comic book to screen"" adaptation.Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!"
30,Black Adam,3," Non-Stop  Non-Fun Action:Black Adam feels like a Marvel movie, except it cares more about how ""cool"" its CGI and action is, which gets in the way of a properly thought-out story and sufficient entertainment. To sum this movie up in one (or two) simple words, it's just completely pointless. Have movie celebrities, actors, directors, writers, producers and storytellers all lost their motivation for big comic book characters that fans actually care about? If they can't come up with good ideas and an actual plot, they may as well just dump the whole project instead of providing people with disappointingly boring action.It's completely undeniable that Black Adam is a blockbuster, considering the nearly $200 million budget and the very well-constructed, fast at times action. Despite excellent costume design for the main superheroes in this movie, as well as the cinematically awesome sound effects and visual work put into the action sequences, this is an incredibly flat, pointless and majorly boring action flick that wastes it cast's potential, opportunity and money. If you care about thematic aspects, Black Adam does take a few breaks to discuss the meanings of being a hero and being a villain, but that's really about it.Story-wise, there's nothing to say or talk about, because there's absolutely no thought for what the film is meant to be about. Again, the fantasy action is done almost impeccably, but it's ruined by the fact that since it has no plot or character development to fill in the gaps, there's flat dialogue and even more action to just pile it up into a long borefest of a mess. The entire thing is convoluted and you can feel every minute of it... Well, at least until the final third where you can feel every millisecond of it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
31,Black Adam,4," Surprised this is getting decent reviews:Thought Bland Adam was another misfire for the DCEU Universe. Basically a poor combination of Justice League, Eternals and Shazam! This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.3.5/10."
32,Black Adam,8," Are they really any bad or good Superhero ?:What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies."
33,Black Adam,2," Absolute garbage:Tragic cinema for brainless people. They even managed to destroy the imagination. Absolute garbage of American stupidity and a cheap copy of other better movies. Fortunately, when we download movies, we can also delete them with a simple tap. This garbage is not even worth seeing.Glad we don't pay for this garbage anymore.This movie was so bad that it's not even worth a review, except to say no acting, all CGI, must be desperate for an income, else can't explain why Dwayne would put his name to it.This movie is just overwhelmingly storyless action, watch it at home and don't pay attention to it but don't rate it any higher than what it is. They are stupidly force marketing the movie and think they can fool audience."
34,Black Adam,4," Goofy and cheesy addition to the ""Injustice"" game series:Honestly, large parts of BLACK ADAM seem like they are cinematics from a hypothetical INJUSTICE game. Rubbery, bad CGI in fights with some cool moments. And it's all fine - until you realize that you don't have a controller in your hands.BLACK ADAM tries to be a darker anti-hero story, but it only succeeds in displaying lots of money being burnt on screen. A cheesy script with cheesy direction and cheesy acting and a very bad score - desperately trying to get your attention with cheesy CGI.Now, there's some nice and cool moments in this, but unfortunately, they don't make up for the horribly bad moments. Just think about an ancient culture, maybe even the oldest one on this planet - and they had some guy with a goofy lightning logo on his chest as their ""champion"". Right.Add a very generic score with insufferable ""beats"", and you get a cheese show deluxe.If anything, the fight between this strangely generic ""Hawkman"" and Black Adam in the kid's room was pretty fun, plus some shots and maybe even some lines in between, but as a whole, this is pretty much a mess from beginning to end - a convoluted two hours that won't really satisfy you. Too many bad lines, bad moments, bad plot points, bad characters and bad visuals that will spoil the fun. The concept is intriguing, though, and I would have loved to see a better script turned into reality by a way better director. Oh well."
35,Black Adam,7," Fast paced action and kinda fun:In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of ""who is really a hero?"" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!"
36,Black Adam,4," Juvenile !!!:This movie is solely for kids and teens, the rest of us would find the characters, dialogues and concept cheesy at best. With the more established super heroes there is a margin of believability we would like to have. Here with Black Adam it is all fantasy and so you never connect with these heroes and their ridiculous powers. Sole dependance on CGI to make a movie is not a great strategy. Dwayne, besides displaying his bulk there wasn't much to like about the Black Adam. I don't know how Pierce Brosnan got roped in, but he looked as out of place as Jim Carrey would look in an action movie. It was almost like he was there as a spoof to all superheroes. While the Atom Smasher guy's uniform looked almost identical to Deadpool and his growing into a giant looks just like what Antman does. Feel sorry for DC as they are desperately trying to compete with Marvel and losing terribly. I don't see this movie growing into a franchise as Dwayne Johnson would lose all credibility as an action heroe if he continues with this drivel."
37,Black Adam,2," Probably the worst DC movie so far:This movie is cheesy and uninspired. The story pace doesn't flow well, characters are one dimensional and the Rock really can't act. These types of movies are supposed to be fun escapism but this one just left me bored and sleepy. It takes itself too seriously. Hollywood needs to realise that it's audience has changed. We have seen these kinds of movies over and over. Now we expect more. Give us better character development, give us complex multifaceted characters. Also the non stop cliches are what makes this movie so uninspired. I thought DC was making a comeback with wonderwoman 1 and the newest suicide squad with giant starfish but unfortunately this is 10 steps back."
38,Black Adam,5," Bland Adam:Black Adam is possibly one of the most generic superhero movies ever made. In a year that also gave us Morbius, that's quite a statement to make, but true. For me, Black Adam sits somewhere between being better than Morbius and Love&Thunder, but far from good.Like many of the DCEU movies, it doesn't set up the characters properly or give us the core reasons we should care about these characters and what their theme is. The Rock's likability and natural charisma and charm is wasted on such a serious, dour character like Black Adam. You can sense the restraint The Rock is using to make Black Adam more ominous and less relatable than his typical schtick, and it makes the character feel clunky as a result.Physically, The Rock is perfectly cast and I've said for many years he should play a comic character. He's one of the few major actors that doesn't need to train at all for the role of a superhero and can show up on-set ready to play the part the day-of. But the physical side can only go so far, and there's moments where The Rock tries to batner with some of the side-characters, but still trying to embody the seriousness of Black Adam, and it just comes off as awkward. Overall, this character just doesn't work for him, and a more standard heroic role with more potential for comedy would've been a better fit.The other heroes introduced, The Justice Society, are for the most part as flat and ineffective as Black Adam himself. It really does seem like Black Adam and the rest of the Justice Society should've been introduced in a previous DCEU project. They have the most ridiculously undercooked plan from a group of superheroes I've seen in a long time, and while the movie tries to hint at self-awareness of this through dialogue, that still doesn't make what they're actually doing with the story good. It really more makes the Justice Society look like clowns. Pierce Brosnan is the best performance in the movie, to nobody's surprise, but even then we get so little of why we should care about the JS and who their characters are. I have to give a mention to Cyclone being arguably the most worthless character in a superhero movie ever. Her tactic against Black Adam, a being as strong as Superman, is to toss pipes at him with the wind, and she contributes more or less nothing the rest of the movie.The movie tries to sell Black Adam as an anti-hero, and tries to make attempts at a sort of moral grey-area, but it falls flat. Intergang, the force invading Khandaq, is objectively evil without any redeeming reason to be there, so when Black Adam kills them, there's not really a sense of shock or any moral deliberation. They're remorseless scumbags conquering a country for their resources (Eternium, not only seeming like a blatant rip-off of Black Panther regardless of whichever came first in the comics, but also the most poorly named fictional material since Unobtanium in Avatar), so aside from the act of murder itself, which they bring on themselves by attempting to mortally kill Black Adam, there's really not much of a moral quandary here. Nothing Black Adam does in the movie embodies the ""anti"" part of being an anti-hero. His actions never lead to an innocent person dying or even getting slightly hurt. This is the kind of content missing from something like Black Adam, that could actually drive a sense of consequence and drama, stuff like that is supposed to be the foundation of comic book stories, but they shy away from taking the story there and attempting to tell us who the characters are through goofy dialogue rather than actions.To contrast with Black Adam, look at another former WWE-star in a DC production: John Cena as Peacemaker from his own show with the same name and '21's The Suicide Squad. Peacemaker actually does hold morally questionable views, is introduced to us as a criminal psychopath, and is blatantly antagonistic to the lead character. In his own show, he grows from these aspects of character and becomes less sociopathic, which is interesting to watch. The main difference there is that The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker had the involvement of James Gunn, who actually knows how to craft oddball characters with a sense of love and a way of making even the weirdest characters endearing.Black Adam shows that after all this time, even with some successes in recent years, the DCEU still doesn't consistently know how to craft interesting characters that feel at least somewhat fleshed out in an inter-connected universe. Everything about Black Adam feels as if a machine was given all the typical elements of a modern superhero movie and made to produce one, without any of the heart or regard to character, or what makes the genre really work. It's good enough to not be awful, but not good enough to be memorable."
39,Black Adam,8," It was surprisingly fun!:I had no knowledge about Black Adam prior to seeing the movie, haven't watched the latest trailers nor had any high expectations before going to the movie.But wow, I was oh boy taken by surprise by the movie!Okay, it's not the best super hero movie out there and doesn't have an overwhelmingly deep story. But it doesn't try to be that either.It was fun, enjoyable, fights where amazing, soundtrack was great, just a well-made hero movie where you can see superhumans dish out in fight!And considering the quality of the MCU we have received recently, I would definitely recommend this one to avid super hero fans!"
40,Black Adam,2," Indefensibly  hilariously bad.:There's a moment, mid-way through this monstrosity of a movie, where Hawkman tells Black Adam that ""heroes don't kill people!"" The irony of hearing him say this after they accidentally level several city blocks and create massive collateral damage is so hilariously contradictory, the fact that they don't waste another tired joke on that is astounding.This movie... I really don't know where to start. Characters so paper-thin you can (sometimes literally) see right through them; a structure that continuously has you asking ""when is the story going to start?""; a visual miasma of ridiculously dated CGI (yes, show me the speed ramp/slow down EVERY TIME we see cyclone, that won't get old at all!); a complete lack of backstory (what... is... Hawkman?); a villain who can, apparently, just be ripped in half; and technical errors so egregious, I can't believe the incorrect ADR and absurd editing choices got into the Final Cut without the editor deliberately playing a prank on the audience.And the JOKES. Oh my GOD. So many, and they're all so BAD. Not just bad: they completely deflate all tension. Why should I feel stress for a child character if he's quipping all through the drama?Oh, and remember when the rock had a personality? Pepperidge farm remembers. And Pepperidge farm also remembers when movies made sense. ""Let's put black Adam in a cage forever!"" *five minutes later* ""we need black Adam to save the world! Release him from his cage in a ridiculous slow-motion sequence in which a de-powered Black Adam still manages to beat a dozen armed swat teams at a black site!""And what on earth is Black Adam going to do against SUPERMAN?!What a garbage fire."
41,Black Adam,3," I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam.:I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud & messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed."
42,Black Adam,2," Wow what a f'n waste of time.:This is truly horrible.Acting is so bad, dialogue feels like it's written by some alien who don't understand how humans communicate.So many tropes! ..it's just missing one trope to declare itself a nation.This is alot better than what i expected it to be.I did not have high hopes for this.The rock might be a good entertainer, and be able to do some block busters.This tho is not for me, everything he tried in this just seems like some cosplay stuff and impossible to take ""seriously"".Anyhow the superhero thing is so worn out now, finished with marvel/disney/starwars etc..It's all gone totally down the drain and is just creativly bankrupt.A total waste of time."
43,Black Adam,4," WWE has more story than this movie.:This is like watching Avengers without knowing who is Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Loki and why would we care for them or hate them.The country is overrun by imperialist people, most likely American and for years Justice Society of America was like, yay, no problem, you go ahead. You know because Justice Society of America receive funding from American government who gets money from this imperial people.But out of nowhere some woman remembered, ""Oh Wait, there is this crown and champion"" after 5000 years and knew the exact place and language to awake Adam and find the crown.As soon as champion awake, Justice Society of AMERICA is like, we should treat everyone equally and everyone should be taken to court.If some random woman knew that the crown will raise hell, why did she find the crown in first place?Is Kahandan like ISIS where people are terrorist or it is like country of innocents. They put a boy to show the innocence in the movie."
44,Black Adam,6," Never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed...:No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of ""Black Adam"". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a ""twist"" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to ""The Suicide Squad"" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say ""see look how brutal we can make this"" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with ""look how powerful and ruthless he is"". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" and of course a certain cast member from ""Shazam!"". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the ""Shazam!"" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's ""300"", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- ""Avatar"", ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like ""Venom""... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's ""Black Adam"", especially in a potential ""Black Adam v. Superman"" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!"
45,Black Adam,3," Absolutely Awful!:I was looking forward to this flick, but it was simply awful. If you've seen the clips, you've seen all the best parts of the movie. I wasn't looking for Oscar quality, but at least some semblance of a plot. And I've read plenty of comic books in my day, so I know what a decent comic book plot is like.Visually, the movie was almost entirely CGI and it wasn't the best CGI either. The Rock basically did a few scenes where he showed an angry facial expression and the rest was CGI. And the story, if you can call it that, was sloppy. For example, how does a long dead guy in what I assume is somewhere in the Middle East get resurrected speaking perfect American English? And why does the Justice Society just attack him without finding out his story?The movie was so bad even my 13 year old son left the theater saying it was one of the worst movies he's ever seen. Hawkman was the one redeeming aspect of the movie. It was nice to see him introduced to the DC cinematic universe.If you want to see it, best to wait until it comes out to stream at home for a few bucks."
46,Black Adam,3," So cheesy:I had such high hopes and I always enjoy The Rocks movies. But, I should have asked for nachos as cheesy as this movie ended up being. When they said ""Shazam!"" I cringed, that ruined the whole tone of the movie for me. The whole levitating thing got on my nerves too, I think Adam sat down once. I just didn't understand the need to levitate so much. The kid with the skateboard was cookie cutter Disney silly, trying to be funny and not, he just got on my nerves. This movie just ended up being silly and I couldn't wait for it to end. The whole super hero movie has to stop, its just too much and getting old. The whole tone was all wrong. It could have been great, but ended up being a three star buy the end of it."
47,Black Adam,1," Yet another watered down bastardisation:""The film initially received an R rating due to several gruesome death scenes and many cuts had to be made to the film to receive the lower PG-13 rating""^ That is all you need to know about this movie. A team of executives, producers, writers a director, an entire team of absurdly over paid people pitched an idea for a movie based on a comic character.They then hired writers to take certain elements and plot lines from the characters long history and make a movie out of it.They then hired directors, the highest paid yet most one dimensional ""actor"" in history to front it.They spent months having re-writes and changes. Spent months filming scenes over and over again. When they were happy with it it was sent to post production where a team of very highly paid people plastered the movie in special effects.They had it in a studio for weeks to months with music being composed, overlayed, sound lines being re-recorded, foley's producing sounds for movements and atmosphere. Then all of the audio was mixed and overlayed in a way they were happy withAnd then what happened? They took a finished product that they were content was a good vehicle to tell the story and completely buthcered it. Removed any scene that had the character acting like the character he is supposed to be, removed any and all scenes that could possibly be deemed as ""too much"" for a child by the ridiculous american MPAA. They watered down and hacked chunks out of their own product to sell more tickets, even though it was already guaranteed to be a financial success since it has the rocks name attached to it. They destroyed a story that they themselves had concocted and the end result is a completely different end product than what was pitched and even different from what was originally filmed it's dumb it is completely and utterly moronic. If you don't want to make an R rated movie and want to make yet another generic child focused brightly coloured, pun filled movie that has about as much depth as an episode of peppa the pig then do that. Don't take a character who historically has had stories revolving around adult themes, shoot an entire movie retaining the essence of the character and then proceeding to intentionally destroy any semblence of that character or the themes you were part of creating in the first place.I don't care for the rock personally, zero acting ability and a selfish attention seeker in real life, but this movie could and should've been good, he can't act at all but he already has the ego and arrogance that could fit this character, instead we get the most generic, predictable and low effort childish movie that DC has ever churned out."
48,Black Adam,8," Delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre:""Black Adam"" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's ""Shazam!"". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical ""with great power comes great responsibility"" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.As the film is a spin-off from ""Shazam!"", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.It seems long overdue that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like ""Black Adam"" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from ""Shazam!"", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.I rate it 7.5/10."
49,Black Adam,3," Just Another Loud Thump And Bang Superhero Epic!:Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie."
50,Black Panther,5," Dull:I don't have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."
51,Black Panther,3," I wish I enjoyed it like so many  it just bored me.:I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.Dazzling special effects, great acting, but aside from that I couldn't say much in favour of the film, if I'm being totally honest it bored me throughout, I yawned the whole way through, as everything in this movie has been literally done to death, no new ideas, no originality, it felt like a B version of Wonder Woman.I saw it based on the many wonderful and positive reviews, maybe I was having an off day, it just bored me to tears."
52,Black Panther,4," Despite all the hype  pretty much your average comic book movie:After the death of his father, Prince T'Challa ascends to the throne of the small African country of Wakanda. T'Challa is also Black Panther, superhero. Now not only must he govern his country but defeat a dangerous adversary.An average comic book / superhero movie, which doesn't say much. Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead."
53,Black Panther,5, I liked it at first.:I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.
54,Black Panther,5," Absolutely Overrated:""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"
55,Black Panther,1," An Honest Review:I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."
56,Black Panther,1," Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic:I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"
57,Black Panther,5," Over hyped because it has a lot of Black people in it.:First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."
58,Black Panther,6," Doesn't quite reign king:Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
59,Black Panther,2," Disappointing:This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."
60,Black Panther,2," I used to love Black Panther...:Black Panther was the very first black superhero in any main stream comic book to date appearing in 1966, obviously it was a big deal.As a white male, I absolutely love this character, the one from the comics I mean, and not the MCU version, mainly because of all the political agendas that are strewn through the picture, All I can say is enough is enough. Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential. Overall it has decent moments here and there, but nothing new or relevant, not a good movie period."
61,Black Panther,6," Meh  highly overrated - not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie:The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me."
62,Black Panther,6," Good  but not that good...:With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie. Although not among the top of superhero movies for me."
63,Black Panther,6," Not as interest:Having seen the overwhelming critic reviews and overall success and accolades that this film has received, the hype for this Black Panther film was at a height that rarely many superhero films (even films of any genre)have amassed.This film is visually stunning, with great direction, and overall acting. Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."
64,Black Panther,1," Over-hyped - Not enough effort put into core aspects of a film:With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."
65,Black Panther,6," Wishful thinking / Broken ratings / Longread:First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."
66,Black Panther,6," Wakanda:Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."
67,Black Panther,1," Very disappointing...:This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."
68,Black Panther,7," Good movie but completely overrated:Although this is a really good movie, it has amazing costumes, they really got the essence of a African cultures, the cast, in general, did a good job, it still had some problems, including, special effects, character development, wasting such an actor as forest Whitaker and a really common narrative superheroe story. In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."
69,Black Panther,7," Long love the king:Watched this in double viewing for Wakanda Forever. I enjoyed this on second viewing more. Firstly I just want to say how they left those women in the jungle to fend for themselves at the beginning of the movie to save Nakia, it was never addressed lol, didn't notice the first time.Anyway some of the fight scenes felt slow and weren't as intense, notably the first challenge for the throne with M'baku but I think that's only because I saw people saying the cgi wasn't great in this over the past couple years since it's release. But not something you'd notice if you aren't looking for it. And the accent, it's the ""Hollywood African accent"" and even with that, it was inconsistent at times.The movie felt pretty comedic, one of the movies were marvel put in just the right amount of humor without overdoing it. First two thirds of the movie felt like spy movie just with superheroes in the mix. It was pretty action packed.It hit almost every possible movie cliche at every chance it got though which was it's biggest problem. However to make up for all that, it was also the first black hero and broke many barriers. First time I watched it I didn't get the hype, I enjoyed better on second viewing but can still see why. If you put aside that this was the first African hero solo movie; there isn't much to set it apart from any other mcu project, but if you consider what it meant to a lot of people, then you may understand and perhaps warrant the hype and love the movie received.It blinds you from everything the movie wasn't so spectacular at. Even with all that aside I still think it's a pretty decent movie and thinking of the representation, it's even better. It's a movie you can love because it gave a hero who you could easily root for."
70,Black Panther,1," Overrated  dull and boring. Waste of time.:This is a movie you will like watching it the first time because everyone else is jumping on the band wagon. Many months later, your subconscious tells you this movie was completely overrated and a complete and utter waste of time. Watch it once, but it lacks the charm of other Marvel movies."
71,Black Panther,2," An Exercise In Nonsense:This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."
72,Black Panther,8," Long Live the King:Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."
73,Black Panther,4," Black Panther: The emperor isn't wearing any clothes!:Marvel fantasy origin film. Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.
Overly long (134 minutes), very disappointing and boring."
74,Black Panther,1," Most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time??:Subpar to say the least. Political partisanship has now cemented its ugly head into almost every movie being delivered for mass consumption. Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."
75,Everything Everywhere All at Once,10," Fantastic:""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart."
76,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," best film of 2022:Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once."
77,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," Felt Like I Was Seeing the Inside of My Own Mind on Screen:I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).Grade: A."
78,Everything Everywhere All at Once,10," The most original film ever made. Period.:Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again."
79,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!:Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!"
80,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," Don't do drugs  watch this instead.:If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air."
81,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," What a perfect title for this movie.:It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on."
82,Everything Everywhere All at Once,4," ""I got bored one day and put everything on a bagel."":Well, where to start? I'm going to try to be fair with my review but quite honestly, it's going to be difficult not to be flippant. The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.What I can say perhaps in defense of the film is that it truly lives up to its name because it does try to be everything, everywhere, all at once. For me, not a good thing. It was as if you took any number of random ideas and concepts and threw them into a blender to see what came out. For example, green eggs and ham, Topo Gigio, e=mc squared, pineapple pizza, and squirrel nut zippers. See how easy it is? I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, 'Please God, let this be over'.I guess I'd have to give credit to the film makers at least for an ambitious editing job with the picture's all too frequent scene changes and skip jumps from one thing to another. But I can't help but feel that the sentimental ending was supposed to help you forget what you just went through. And oddly enough, I was able to follow the main story line well enough, but it took forever to make its point, which if I had to summarize, would be:Be kind - even if my review isn't."
83,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," Near Flawless Film:Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie."
84,Everything Everywhere All at Once,7," Absurdity detracts from the awesomeness:Overall I really enjoyed EEAAO. There is an inexplicable draw that some of us feel towards oblivion and a sense of complete nothingness and this movie is pretty good at getting inside your head and taking you for the ride.While I enjoyed the humour, some of it I felt was way too absurd to even be funny. Those in particular being the sausage fingerverse and the butt plug kung-fu scene. These scenes and their attempts at being funny actually detatched me from the otherwise trippy experience of the movie.So overall an enjoyable and unique experience but this movie will definitely not be to everyones liking."
85,Everything Everywhere All at Once,6," Way overhyped:This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though."
86,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," With its strong storyline and amazing parallel universes  this sci fi movie sets a new bar for sci fi:Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future."
87,Everything Everywhere All at Once,," Stunning:It's very rare that I give a movie a full score. This is because when I look at my list later, I want full score movies to really mean something. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" was such a masterpiece, being both experimental yet grounded, absurdist yet profound. Everything about this film was amazing. The story. The performances. Even the metatextual casting of Michelle Yeoh is fascinating, since Michelle Yeoh is an actress that really has lived a million lives in her own multiverse. This film absolutely floored me."
88,Everything Everywhere All at Once,6," Aimless:This film wasn't for me. Weird for the sake of being weird. What it attempted to do was something that can't be done. Similar to TENANT, it's a concept of the intangibles with the overall theme of love falling flat because there's simply too much going on.Hence the name.It's well acted, well produced with amazing choreography but as a movie its just odd. Original yes, but odd and hard to become attached."
89,Everything Everywhere All at Once,10," The best movie of the 2020s so far:Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was ""a woman tries to do her taxes,"" and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.Believe the hype.Go in knowing as little as possible.See this movie."
90,Everything Everywhere All at Once,3," Absolutely bonkers   and not for me:Beautifully filmed and everyone hamming it up . Started up promising but then I completely lost the plot....
I was prepared to give it a chance and watched it till the end ....urghh unbearable in parts ...couldn't wait till it finished .Yeah yeah I get the message love can be found in even the worst situations no matter how desperately bad or bleak .Michelle Yeoh great and Jamie Lee Curtis a real treat - she made it tolerable .Not for me am too old ,...or not old enough !Why do I need 600 characters to post ? Unbelievable............................................................................................................................................"
91,Everything Everywhere All at Once,9," Most accurate title ever:This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels)."
92,Everything Everywhere All at Once,4," What a Mess:It's been a long time since i felt this way watching a film and wanting it just to end, This is a perfect example of how a good idea can turn into a waste. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately i felt frustrated, irritated, disgusted and bored all at once."
93,Everything Everywhere All at Once,6," It was just fine. Hear me out...:At the risk of angering what seems to be the entire movie going populous, I'm just gonna say it - this movie is fine.Funny in places, exciting in places, pretty emotional in places. But can someone please explain why movies these days feel like they need to be so damn long? Seriously, this could have been 100 minutes, easily. It's way too indulgent. Scenes drag on and on and when they're over you're still no further to any semblance of plot clarity than you were 10 minutes earlier. It seems like they shot tonnes of footage and just wanted to include it all, without really embellishing the actual story. If the movie was more succinct and arrived more quickly at the overall point of the narrative, that being her connection with her daughter, I would have liked it a lot more.I just really don't understand why producers and writers are electing their films to be these immense lengths these days when they really don't need to be. No Way Home, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, Drive My Car, all over 2 hours for no good reason.I really felt the length of this movie was to the detriment of the overall narrative and it disallowed me appreciating what the message was meant to be.That being said, the direction and editing was cool, acting was strong and the scene at the end with the daughter really did hit all the right notes. You could have trimmed a lot of fat off of this though and made it far stronger in my opinion."
94,Everything Everywhere All at Once,8," Bonkers!:Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as ""Daniels"", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the ""normal"" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel""), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as ""Big Nose"", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022."
95,Everything Everywhere All at Once,4," My head!!!!:I think they were trying to be deep and profound, but what resulted was two hours of head-splitting chaos and confusion. It is a shame, because I had high hopes for this movie. I just don't understand the hype. They tried too hard to be weird. I think at the end they were trying to pull the heartstrings, but I was too confused to know for sure. I'm not even sure what the movie was about. I think it had something to do with familial relations, or perhaps current tax laws? Whatever it was, they should have had an epileptic seizure warning."
96,Everything Everywhere All at Once,10," Ingenuously  Honestly  Chaotically  Beautifully  Frantically  Quietly  Open-Heartedly  Simply Magnificent:Michelle Yeoh and the rest of the cast and crew KNOCK this mind-bending, multi-universe film right out of the entirety of space and time, and take our minds, funny bones and our hearts along for the ride.If you're one of the ones who were not quite transported through the exquisite subtleties or the outright power of this film, do yourself a favor and watch it again."
97,Everything Everywhere All at Once,5," Massively over rated.:I haven't reviewed a film on here for years but was compelled to do so after having been subjected to this mess.Although it was very ambitious and occasionally funny in a slightly campy way, I'm flabbergasted at the positivity about this ill thought out, hotchpotch of disparate cinema genres.The idea of exploring the multiverse through the prism of Kung-fu fighting and kinky sex is ludicrous.Maybe it will become a cult film best watched while tripping but definitely not the 'profound' experience people are describing here..."
98,Everything Everywhere All at Once,3," Sound and Fury  Signifying Everything Everywhere All at Once:I'd heard good things about this, but the fact of the matter is it's basically just any of the Matrix films jumbled up with some overused Spider-verse/ Dr Strange / Rick & Morty, etc. ""multiverse"" plot ideas that I've seen far too many times now to find innovative or get excited over.I admire the filmmakers attempting something technically more challenging than the average flick but the end result is just a very shallow and boring film with no interesting characters to connect with or care about, and it felt to me just another one of those recent things made by people who've grown up almost exclusively on video games and so confuse unlocking game levels with storytelling. Because of this, no characters feel real or believable: everyone in it's just an NPC, and so their lives and life events have no weight or depth.It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing, and I'm sorry to have to say I couldn't get all the way through it. But my own life's better for that."
99,Everything Everywhere All at Once,3," I am genuinely confused:Now I'm clearly a minority based on the reviewers but that's ok, how is this an 8.9 on IMDB? It was confusing, overly long and repetitive. I'm giving up on these films, same as French Dispatch, rubbish. I cannot work out what it was about and why I paid $20 to watch it."
100,Nope,6," Good  but still misses a mark....:6.7/10While ""Nope"" is a visual spectacle I found that it didn't sit as well as I would've hoped when it came to the story. However, it still manages to reach its goal of entertaining on some level.The film felt slightly long due to the first and third acts feeling fast and somewhat stuffed with a lot of goings ons while the second act felt very slow and drawn out. The long parts put me into a state of boredom, and even further than that, once the reveal of the antagonist happened, the magic and tension disappeared. Before that tension disappeared I found there was some good tension built up due to the soundtrack, but again, things fell short.As for the horror parts, I assumed there would be more than just the ones shown in the commercial, and while there was, again a lot of the horror/magic disappeared once the antagonist was shown.I did find the acting to be very engaging. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer each brought great energy to their roles, and the supporting actors were equally enjoyable.Overall, a decent film, but if I could go back I would wait to see it on a cheap night. Acting was enjoyable, the cinematography was spectacular, but the story, the length of the film, and the antagonist weren't up to the par I was expecting.Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
101,Nope,2," Slow over-hyped boring:I'm that kind of person who loves Extraterrestrial movies. About half an hour, there were no sign of Aliens or UFO whatsoever. At some point, you might think, you are watching a wrong movie. Even so, I gather much patience and I kept watching this. I thought, it might be a slow burner. But, when I saw a UFO in the screen, I was like now the show begins. Instead, I got disappointment again. The movie is super slow. The creature was cartoonish. Now,I'm thinking or I'm rewarding myself, I have so much patience that I finished this slow boring movie. Don't let RATINGS misguide you ')
It isn't worth watching :) I regret wasting my 2 hours + on this."
102,Nope,2," Seriously disappointing.:There is no easy way to put this subtly. This movie is boring. It's about 40 minutes too long. The first hour i was wondering when something was going to happen. The swcond hour I was wondering when it would end.Any attempts at humour fell flat. The acting was just wooden for the most part. The story could of been good but it was just dragged along.I really struggle to find anything good to say about it. In retrospect I'd of been better of watching ""Get Out"" or ""Us"" again. They are great movies. This is not even close to those standards.Seriously not recommended. Not even just to watch once. It's over 2 hours and could of been covered in an hour or less."
103,Nope,1," Close Encounters of the Turd Kind.:In 2015 my son insisted we watch Brendan Fraser 'comedy' Furry Vengeance (2010). I forgave him. Eventually. Today he suggested we go see Nope. It's going to be a long time before I am able to let this one go. Directed by Jordan Peele, Nope is without a doubt the worst film I have ever seen at the cinema in almost fifty years of movie-going, and quite possibly the most tedious movie I have seen, period.The plot is disjointed and repetitive with many scenes making very little sense, the pacing is incredibly slow, and the characters are hugely irritating (Keke Palmer and Michael Wincott were awful, and Stephen Yeun and Brandon Perea weren't much better). I have no idea what Peele was aiming for: I don't understand the relevance of the killer chimpanzee and the floating shoe, or how fifty skydancers (those inflatable figures on car showroom forecourts that gyrate in the wind) can be purchased and installed in a matter of hours. I fail to see how a massive flying extraterrestrial that feeds on people can go unnoticed for so long. Why did OJ and Emerald speak like they were from an inner city ghetto when they were born and raised in the country? Would Emerald really be into The Jesus Lizard? And who was that person on the motorcycle and why was his helmet so strange?Knowing Peele, there is undoubtedly hidden meaning and symbolism in the film, but I don't go to the cinema to be bored out of my skull for well over two hours and then have to research what it was all about afterwards. I want to be entertained. And I most definitely wasn't. I'd rather watch a double bill of Cats (2019) and Birds of Prey (2020) than watch Nope again."
104,Nope,3," An apt title:""Nope"" is the next disappointment by Jordan Peele who, with each movie, seems to look more and more like a one hit wonder. ""Get Out"" was an incredible thriller that fired on every cylinder and hit every note; ""Us"" had a phenomenal trailer, but seemed to confuse audiences with its convoluted and borderline pretentious ending where, the more you think about things, the less sense they make. ""Nope"" follows that same vein, and I can't help but think that Peele feels as if he needs to shock and awe when, perhaps, a more simple, straightforward tale would have worked better.""Nope"" is two hours and ten minutes long, so you could say that this isn't a short, breezy film. And I don't necessarily have a problem with that. The problem is, however, that ""Nope"" doesn't have much to say, do, or tell within that lengthy run time. A slow burn to its very core, ""Nope"" takes its sweet time setting up the story that it wants to tell - scratch that, though, because there isn't much of a story here in the first place. If you've seen the second trailer for this film, you know that it's about two ranchers who seem to witness an unidentified flying object in the skies above and, as they are both down on their luck and strapped for cash, they decide to set up some cameras in hopes of capturing said UFO on film so they can sell the footage. An interesting, if bare bones, premise to be sure, but surely one that gives way to the real meat, hook, and plot of the film, no?Nope. The story never gets any grander or more unique than its initial set up. Sure, there is a subplot that is, granted, pretty intense, leading to a few unique and twisted scenes, but it hardly adds anything to the movie except an added running time. Without spoilers, the subplot has to do with a certain animal; while I understood what they were going for, I couldn't help but wonder why the scenes didn't get cut in editing to create a tighter, more focused story, as I imagine the entire point of the subplot will fly over the heads of many.The simple premise wouldn't be a problem if the film led to a bombastic and satisfying conclusion, but it doesn't. Throwing its simple premise out the window to instead attempt to surprise audiences with a twist that is somehow more underwhelming than my life, ""Nope"" devolves into a parody of itself by the end. I don't want to spoil anything, but I do want to say that the final act reveal takes all mystery, suspense, tension, and horror out of the picture completely - I literally couldn't believe my eyes; I mean, who thought what they did would be a good idea on any level, especially visually? Let's just say that, in this case, less would have been more.""Nope"" was a disappointment to me, and is further proof that Jordan Peele is - sadly - becoming a one hit wonder. A tighter, more streamlined and focused story would've worked wonders here, especially in helping to create the horror film that this movie was advertised as being. It pains me to say, however, that viewers may not find the contents of the film horrifying as much as they may find themselves scared of ""Nope's"" utter mediocrity."
105,Nope,3," A Fitting Title...:This may be the most apropos title for a movie in the history of the cinema, as in nope, don't bother to see it.How may I put this succinctly. Ah, yes. Giant, predatory, carnivorous alien-jellyfish-amoeba that won't eat you if you don't look at it. With this submission, Jordan Peele may very well be cementing his claim as the next M. Night Shamylan, and that isn't meant as a compliment.I had a choice between ""NOPE"" and "" The Black Phone"". I should have gone to see ""The Black Phone"" instead."
106,Nope,1," Too bad...:I know Jordan Peele wants to write, direct and produce his own movies and appear like a genius but the writing is horrible here. If he keeps doing this he will end up like Spike Lee, making long movies with lame dialogs that go nowhere.Some of it is just so over the top and some too unrealistic, like the guy they bought the security system from. He was the only cashier in the store and ends up taking a van to do the install at the ranch himself, then he shows pictures of his girlfriend and talks about his life to the customer. Oh and the same guy also remotely monitors the cameras. WHAT?Keke Palmer over acts every scene she's in. It was annoying. Daniel Kaluuya has this look on his face like he smelled somebody's fart at all times. Oh and there is zero siblings chemistry between the two of them and they do not look like siblings, not even by a thousand miles.The acting in this movie is really bad except Steven Yeun, and even the blood looks fake. The attempts at creating tension fail, the attempts at providing humor fail.I was a big fan of Get Out and Us, but Jordan Peele needs to take a break and think about his movie making."
107,Nope,8," YEP (spoilers after a warning):Original, creative, creepy and suspenseful. Jordan Peele continues to show off his skills as a director. From a technical perspective, this is top-notch across the board. The way sound is strategically used is masterful. My only downsides with the movie are the comedy not always working (not as much as with Get Out), and it taking a little while to get going. But after really disliking Us, I see this as a major bounce-back.I strongly recommend avoiding trailers or any plot details. I went in knowing absolutely nothing other than ""Jordan Peele."" Going through the story as it unfolds and discovering what it's about is such a fun experience. I also recommend seeing it in IMAX since some scenes have an expanded aspect ratio. If not IMAX then any premium screen that will enhance the sound and images.EDIT: I liked Nope even better on second viewing. I noticed so many little details as well as repeated references to the main theme, resulting in a much better flow. And I didn't feel any slowness early in the movie like I did the first time, possibly because I was expecting it and knew it was worth it. Changing rating from 7 to 8 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/21/2022, IMAX 8/3/2022)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSThis movie reminds me a lot of Signs. The way the suspense levels are through the roof in the horror moments. The way the movie is so confined with a small cast, yet feels huge. And the way various story elements and details come together at the end, with credit going to good writing. After making this connection, I found out that Jordan Peele specifically said Signs was one of his inspirations for Nope.Once I realized the movie is about aliens, I started wondering what direction they would go for the look of the aliens. We've seen so many versions that it's difficult to come up with something new or creative. But instead of the typical humanoid creatures or something like Zerg from StarCraft or Starship Troopers, he goes in a completely different direction with the entire UFO being a single alien being. Talk about thinking outside the box. When it opens up during the climax, it looks incredible.Also, I was so happy/impressed when I realized the climax would take place during daytime so we could see everything.The part with the chimp does not seem vital to the plot (at first glance, at least). This would normally be a downside, but I think there are two reasons it works. One is that the scene is unbelievably creepy and jaw-dropping. And two, it does connect to a couple themes. It parallels the alien behavior with predatory tendencies, being territorial, and not looking it in the eyes. And the irony of Jupe doing the same thing as an adult as he did as a child, dealing with a beast he couldn't control, once again resulting in disaster.There is probably a lot more to be explored. I look forward to watching it again and then checking out some explained/explored videos on youtube.EDIT: I am writing this before watching any explored videos. On second viewing, I noticed the theme of not being able to control a beast is touched on throughout the movie, even as early as the commercial shoot. Same with the theme of spectacle/wanting to be seen. I didn't make all the connections the first time.I originally didn't think much of the shoe standing up. But they show it a few times, intentionally. And I don't believe there is evidence of anything supernatural. So that got me thinking. And I have a theory.The probability of a nickel landing on its side is estimated to be one in 6,000. It seems almost impossible. But if you drop a nickel repeatedly, it's not only probable, it's nearly inevitable. As number of drops goes to infinity, probability of landing on its side goes to 100%.If we assume that's what the shoe represents, how does it connect to the movie? Apply that same logic to the theme of not being able to control a beast. No matter how well-tamed, no matter how long you've built trust, no matter how unlikely it is for something to cause it to become ultra aggressive, on a long enough timeline it becomes an inevitability.I could be way off, but it's cool to think about."
108,Nope,3," An incompetent UFO obsesses over a few people:You've seen movies where aliens try to take over the world or demolish a city. But what about a movie where a UFO just tries to (unsuccessfully) vacuum up 3 or 4 people on a horse ranch? Well, you're in luck. The aliens' attempts to kidnap humans are thwarted by the simplest means, such as by simply staying inside. Also horses seem to give them a lot of trouble, which is unfortunate given that the aliens have chosen a horse ranch as their location of choice. Go to 1:57 of the movie to see the dumbest ending ever. Or if you actually decide to watch the whole movie, notice that the inside of the UFO looks like a bounce house you rent for kids birthday parties."
109,Nope,2," Nope:Very disappointing film that show Peele needs to stop writing his own movies and work with a script professional on new projects. This is a complete mess of a film that is hard to follow, has dislikable characters, makes absolutely no sense...and the only good part is a weird CGI monkey that is on screen for just a few short moments. The whole movie should have been about the monkey. Peele is an overrated hack whose world view is cynical and lame."
110,Nope,2, compared to is other work this one was real bad:Its not the actors because they are all excellent. I guess its the plot of the movie and how slow it is to start or get going.From the first 10 minutes i thought it would be a good movie but after 30 minutes it went downhill fast and the ending was even worst.
111,Nope,1," Genuinely one of the worst films ever made.:Simple start to this review, this is film is complete rubbish. Here's why:Terrible pacing.Showing people doing nothing with no purpose, not moving the plot forwards or developing the story or characters is boring, simple as that. The whole first 40 mins could be removed, and no one would notice.Terrible characters.Spending time with Em, would be like spending the weekend using a pair of cheese graters as headphones. What an annoying character she was. The male chap, a man that looked like a constipated person on suicide watch, who had listened to too many Morrissey records. He was about as interesting as listening to an 8-hour insurance seminar.The Plot.The main characters motivation is to get some money, well, so why spend a fortune on camera equipment? Does anyone believe a photo of an alien craft (as they thought it was) would make money, there are plenty on the internet.Lack of logic/Believability.For some reason this creature for the most part hides in a cloud and picks off a couple of horses, not to raise any suspicion. By the end of the film, it is zooming around in clear daylight, not giving a jot about being seen.Don't Knows (you must imagine the ""don't know"" is said in a sarcastic drawn-out way).How did it get there, how long has it been there, can it reproduce.... Don't know.It only affects electrical devices as it flies over them, okay so film it from a far, with a zoom lens, problem solved, why don't they do this? Don't know.At one point it turns into a cross between a camp lampshade and a tissue paper exhibition, why, for what reason.... Don't know.It decides to throw up/relieve itself on a small house in the middle of nowhere, why... Don't know.It doesn't attack people if they don't look at it, wouldn't that make it very easy to deal with then? Why did it attack the man with the silver helmet then.... Don't know.Why would Jupe have a ""show"" to meet the aliens, how did he know about them, why didn't he mention it to anyone, didn't he think about the potential danger.... Don't know.Why does the creature hang around the place with the least amount of its food source.... Don't know.I could go on an on. What is shocking, are the arrogant pretentious reviews, ""you didn't get it"". I go to see a movie to be entertained/surprised/moved/informed. I don't go to see a movie to be boring, silly, and empty, but is really meant to be symbolic/allegorical/existential, so therefore I should review it as brilliant, even if it sends most people to sleep.We can all pretend any poor film was meant to be mean this that and the other, it was badly made crap, stop trying to make excuses.What's next, Plan 9 From Outer Space, was genius representing the struggle of communism against the West."
112,Nope,6," Not Sure Where Jordan Was Going:I hope we are not about to see the Shyamalan effect with Jordan Peele, where the debut film is amazing and everything that follows leaves you scratching your head. I feel like I'm on that road with Peele's body of silver screen work. ""Get Out"" was a masterpiece, while ""Us"" jus didn't do it for me and now ""Nope!""Keke Palmer did her thing in the role she played (she is the star of this movie for sure) and Daniel kept up with a good performance in his own right, but the film itself was something outta the Twilight Zone. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror flick, it had too many holes and unanswered questions for my liking. Peele's approach to filmmaking is amazing, much like Shyamalan, but the stories, like Shyamalan's are starting to fall short of being good films.Jordan may have dreamt this story and woke up at 5am and jotted down every detail he could remember. And like our weird dreams, they never make any sense and we forget a lot of the details by the time we wake up! Nope was like one of those weird a... dreams!"
113,Nope,4," Veering Dangerously Close to M. Night Shyamalan Territory:I have had a ""theory"" for a long time that the success or failure of movies in this day and age can usually be directly related to the quality of the screenplay - usually the story or the plot. I mean, cinema technology nowadays is fantastic; editing, cinematography, special effects are all great, and acting is usually decent. But it really comes down to the story, doesn't it? I mean, it either makes sense and holds together or it doesn't, and that to my mind is the failure of ""Nope"".""The Sixth Sense"" was a tremendous movie with its once in a lifetime twist ending, but since then Shyamalan's output has been at best mediocre. I mean, come on, movies like ""Signs"" or ""The Village"" or ""Lady in the Water"" are cringe-inducing. How does this guy keep getting studios to put up millions of dollars for garbage like that? It really seems as though Shyamalan had the one great inspiration with ""The Sixth Sense"" and has made a career of people hoping he has another one like that in him.I am a little concerned that Jordan Peele's career is following the same trajectory. ""Get Out"" was tremendous, a deservedly big hit and award winner, but he has not lived up to its standard with ""Us"" and ""Nope"".I kept waiting for plot threads to come together and for the movie to stay true to its own internal logic, but it just didn't. This was one of those movies where, when it ends, you just kinda go ""Wait! There must be something more to this. Is that really it?""
Having said that, Peele does succeed in creating an atmosphere of forboding, and, just like ""Us"" I enjoyed watching it even though I was in the end disappointed. He has a LONG way to go before he reaches the depths to which Shyamalan has fallen; let's fervently hope he rights the ship long before then."
114,Nope,6," Almost but not quite:It starts off a little humorous, thought the directing was great to take it from there into a more tense, on edge film. I however don't think this is horror, more of sci-fi but unlike sci-fi movies this one didn't really expose much of the otherworldly parts of it, which was great in the beginning because it built up suspense but since we don't learn much about the ""alien"" you're left with more questions than answers which annoyed me. Thought the premise of the movie was going to be hard to pull off since it's set in the middle of nowhere but they did. Story telling is good and paced well, I love how they added the chimpanzee story arc but I'm disappointed that was the most gruesome part in the movie. You don't get to see how the alien got there, why OJ somehow figured it's territorial, what is actually happening inside the ship, or how Jupe and his wife's circus ruckus never stirred up more attention on previous occasions.... in short, it lacks depth and I think it would have elavated it from just a good movie to a great one.The performances were amazing, loved how calm Kaluya's character was, felt realistic for me. It's often said black people don't usually feature in horrors because once something's fishy we dip, but if we didn't I think this was a more realistic take by the whole cast, upped the rating for me. Peele's concept and directing was great, it was great to see a horror that's not leaning on jump-scares. But as I said this isn't a horror, not in the typical sense of making you scared to turn off the lights to sleep; but it's the nearest genre you could put it in other than sci-fi. I think movies like this, or The invisible man, Ready or not, Midsommer, Fresh, maybe even Us aren't really horrors and a sub genre should be found; because you expect to be scared when you watch a horror so it feels mis-categorized. Nope felt more like a psychological sci-fi thriller or drama than actual horror.There was a good movie in here, it just needed more development and depth to go along with everything else the movie did right, it's like when you have a brilliant idea but don't think it through in detail so it just comes off shallow."
115,Nope,4," More like  Huh??:I'm not really sure what I just saw. This has to be one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. As per usual, Peele raises a ton of questions in his film without touching anywhere close to the answers. And let's face it, it's the same premise as Tremors, only it's in the sky. Nothing really amazingly new or anything. Just weird. The best part of the movie, honestly, ends up being a prank by a bunch of kids. (IYKYK)"
116,Nope,4," Very bad and over-hyped film:Don't believe the silly IMDB rating, this was not a good movie.The UFO ""reveal"" is very silly and anti-climactic, and all interest is lost when that occurs. The only reason is gets 4 stars from me is the cinematography of an isolated California ranch, and the night time shots of the lonely ranch are also very well done, with appropriate spookiness and great atmosphere of the setting.Otherwise, a silly and pretentious and non-scary, non-horror movie that will only please those looking for another mediocre ""diversity"" type movie. There are about a million more being made by Hollywood these days."
117,Nope,5," That's a 'nope' from me  dawg!:The way most critics are raving about ""Nope"" makes me wonder if I've been the victim of an elaborate prank where I was shown a different film than what they have been watching.Because ""Nope"" is, at best, adequate -- a watchable sci-fi action picture that, if it weren't for the fact that it's directed by an Oscar-winning red-hot director and has a budget of roughly $60 mil and stars an Oscar-winning actor, would not be out of place among the myriad of B-movies that litter the virtual shelves of Netflix or Prime Video.First, the good stuff: the film looks gorgeous. Lots of beautiful shots of cloudy skies and spectacular night and day vistas. It was shot on Imax cameras by a master (Hoyte Van Hoytema, Christopher Nolan's regular cinematographer), and it shows. And the dark, foreboding imagery helps Jordan Peele build some effective tension during the first half of the film, when the audience (and the film's characters) still don't know exactly what's going on and what exactly is threatening them.But then the film devolves into a mess where everyone (including the main antagonist) behaves illogically because that's what the plot requires them to do in order to hit all the subtextual marks that Jordan Peele wants them to deliver. And therein lies the biggest problem with the film: it's a very unsubtle 'message' movie, and Jordan Peele, really wants you to get what he's trying to say, to the point of driving the point home with a hammer, over and over.Without going into spoiler territory, the film's plot is a not-so-veiled metaphor for the state of entertainment in our society. All the characters have some sort of connection to the entertainment industry in some form and/or are meant to symbolize a facet of it: the protagonists are two African American siblings, one of whom runs the family business, a ranch providing horses for Hollywood movies; the other is a wannabe performer/entertainer.Their business is dying: animals are being supplanted by CGI, and horses can be unpredictable on set and hard to control, and therefore replaceable. Any parallel with the perception of people of color in the same industry is of course not accidental. Then you have the kid who works at (now defunct) Fry's Electronics and is all about digital videos and streaming content. His name is Angel, probably because calling him YouTube or TikTok would have been a tad too transparent. Then there's the the grizzled, obsessed old filmmaker (played by Michael Wincott, your go-to guy when you want someone who looks gruff and curmudgeonly, down to the 'I just swallowed drain cleaner' hoarse voice) who is disillusioned with the drivel he's forced to shoot nowadays and is ready to roll with his trusty hand-cranked non-digital film camera and to sacrifice everything to the altar of cinematic art.We also have the Asian cowboy slash circus entertainer (Steven Yeun) who suffered a traumatic event as a child actor which left him with deep unhealed psychological scars simmering under the surface, which all stereotypical ex-child actors are supposed to have and which of course will lead him to make horribly wrong, life-changing decisions. And, in what is the most transparent cypher in film packed to the gills with them, you have a TMZ reporter that is not even given a name or a face: he just shows up at some point on an electric motorcycle wearing a reflective helmet (get it? He's just mirroring society's obsession with capturing celebrities' life! Hoo boy!) and expensive cameras. And of course we all know how Hollywood feels about paparazzi, so if you can't guess what's going to happen to him, you will love this film unironically.Nobody in the film behaves the way a regular human being would. They do things because Jordan Peele needs them to deliver a message to the audience, logic and common sense be damned. I'm not even sure the film takes place in the real world, since all the events seem to involve only this microcosm of characters and nobody else. It's like a Beckett play, except that the stage is a vast valley in the California desert inhabited only by a handful of people and the outside world doesn't exist and is somehow unaware of the very visible and bizarre events taking place.Imagine if Jaws took place in the California desert and the shark had a message against Hollywood and showbiz consumerism painted in bright neon letters on its side, and Brody, Quint and Hooper were replaced by much less competent characters whose purpose is not to kill the man-eating menace but to take pictures of it so they can sell it to Oprah and become rich, and you'll have a pretty good idea of the basic plot of ""Nope"" (and the Jaws comparisons don't end there -- you'll see what I mean at the end of the film).As a scary movie, Nope is pretty devoid of actual scares (Peele has to resort to the oldest trick in the book, the 'jump scare', in a couple of occasions). It's also surprising tame in the blood and gore department (most of the carnage takes place offscreen).The talented cast does what they can with the material. Daniel Kaluuya's OJ is nicely understated: a no-nonsense guy who seems to react to most of the craziness around him with a shrug or by saying ""nope"" (of course). Kiki Palmer is fine as his sister, though in typically cliched fashion, she suddenly switches from ""shrieking, terrified woman"" to ""resourceful heroine"" when the plot demands it. But they can't save the film because they have to go through the motions of a plot that becomes increasingly preposterous (the plan that they devise in the third act makes no sense the more you think about it)
Nope continues the downward trajectory of Jordan Peele after Get Out and Us. The former, still a modern masterpiece, succeeded because the metaphorical subtext didn't get in the way of the plot: even if you completely ignored the clear references to slavery and race relationships, it still worked perfectly as a basic thriller.Us was where we started getting hints Peele's ambition might exceed his grasp (it was deliciously creepy and well executed, but the basic concept of a race of ""alternate"" underground dwelling doppelgangers was too bonkers and forced to work)
And now we have Nope, where nothing makes sense outside of its function as a delivery system for Peele's criticism of Hollywood, its treatment of minorities, and our society's total dependence on entertainment at all costs.I've seen critics make favorable comparison between Jordan Peele and Steven Spielberg (mainly due to the very evident influence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the aforementioned ""Jaws), but a more apt comparison would be with M. Night Shyamalan, another director who hit the jackpot early in his career with a terrific movie and then proceeded to squander his potential with increasingly ambitious and less effective muddled message films.In many ways, Nope is Jordan Peele's ""Signs"". Still enjoyable in parts, but too self-conscious for its own good and a far cry from the promise shown with Get Out."
118,Nope,2," Identity Crisis:Nope had too many subplots between the horses, a brother and a sister, an Asian cowboy, the UFO, and a electronic store employee.The acting and cinematography was great. However the plot felt messy. I don't know if it was a sci-fi, drama, mystery, or something else.Capture the UFO on camera. Okay but they had an issue, the UFO wanted to toy with their electronics. Which makes it difficult to capture.I thought they will be famous. Nope. Their was a boss battle. It was epic but felt short.The UFO looked so weird, I couldn't set my attention on it. I don't know if it was a cowboy hat or a flying Wedding dress.We'll it kept me bored and I couldn't understand what it wanted to be. I wouldn't watch it for a second time.It's a Nope for me."
119,Nope,4," What?:I have no idea what tf this movie was supposed to be about, the story was so random and moved slowly. The acting was decent but there was no substance to the characters. I got nothing."
120,Nope,1, Rating of 7.5?:Who rated this stuff ? Terrible movie......with a dumb ending. Least l got to see it free. Not worth it though. Cloth looking UFOs......not very realistic....it's a definite skip.
121,Nope,8," Symbolism is flying over all of your heads:The amount of reviews calling this pointless and terrible clearly didn't read much into what happens here. Peele is pointing a mirror up to you and the most ironic part is a lot of don't even seem to notice. No, this isn't a typical horror movie. It's more of a Spielbergian blockbuster satire with some amusing moments sprinkled throughout. The ""entity"" is creative and can be quite terrifying. The cinematography is top notch and probably the standout feature of the film, while Kaluuya can say an immense amount without even speaking a word. The screenplay is odd to say the least, but it hits more than it misses.While I still think this is a lesser film than Get Out or Us and it ran a little too long, you have to commend its originality in a summer sea of IP-based films. Peele attempts something profound and unique here, which should be respected regardless of your thoughts on the film."
122,Nope,1, What the hell?:LOUSY sci-fi film dealing with aliens abducting people and animals for some reason. With one exception the acting was terrible full of characters you don't give a damn about. The plot goes all over the place including a subplot involving a killer chimpanzee that--as far as I can tell--had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film! It's also slow-moving (there's no reason for this to run over two hours) and quite frankly boring. Also I couldn't make heads or tales out of the explanation given at the end. Only Brandon Perea as Angel makes this movie watchable. When someone asks you to see it respond with the title of the film!
123,Nope,3," incoherent:An alien presence above a ranch threatens the lives of those below.Plot holes galore add up to sink this film about two-thirds of the way through. Like so many other people, I came to this Jordan Peele film wanting to like it, but just couldn't find enough redeeming factors. The film opens with objects such as keys and coins raining down from the sky, causing at least one fatality. Why did this happen? We are told the official reason was ""probably an airplane."" What, the authorities weren't interested? No proper investigation was ever carried out?From this sloppy beginning we learn later that the Steven Yeun characters knows what he is dealing with, and thinks he controls it, in order to cash in. And he cashes in by.... staging a nightly show to a dozen customers. The man has literally made contact with extra-terrestrial life, and this is all he can come up with to monetize his breakthrough? Any remaining shred of plausibility for this storyworld is lost in this moment.There are a few laughs, Daniel Kaluuya is a brooding and engaging presence, but that is scant reward for the ticket price. The sister is loud and annoying. The alien is super clever, then super dumb. It all fails to cohere around any credible narrative spine. Everyone turned up, but they forgot to write the damn movie."
124,Nope,4," Hell NOPE! NO WAY this movie is 7.1!:It's 4 of 10 @ best. It shouldn't even be considered a horror movie. I wanted to like this movie a whole lot more, & I had no expectation of it. The 1st 2 thirds of the movie was great. We didn't get any back story on the 'monster', b/ ok... I can live w/ that. Daniel Kaluuya & Keke Palmer certainly deliver, the directing was decent & the supporting cast was good, too. Michael Wincott was a nice touch... hardly recognizable. BUT, the f'g ufo/ parachute monster was such a cop out. When the movie went in that direction, I was like NOOOOOOOOO! B/ I'd already watched 2 thirds of the movie, so I just let the rest ride... b/ talk about disappointed. It clearly is the worst of the Jordan Peele movies, in my opinion... w/o a doubt!"
125,Thor: Love and Thunder,6," Enjoyable but empty:Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better."
126,Thor: Love and Thunder,2," Christian bales great performance wasted in a joke of a film.:Christian Bale is great, Russell Crowe has a good moment, Hemsworth is good but this movie cannot be saved from a terrible script, bad direction and stupid humour that overstays its welcome."
127,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," Worst MCU yet  things keep getting worse...:I think most people thought it was a big mistake when Disney cut ties with Lord & Miller before they completed their Solo film. Now I'm not so sure. It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi's other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)The real problem with Thor: Love and Thunder is that it is so irreverent but they also try to tackle heavier topics. The film starts with the death of a child, it focuses on a major character dealing with cancer, and the villain is literally called ""the god butcher."" Going back to my comparison to The Naked Gun, it's like you are watching that film and the filmmakers expect you to feel bad about Nordberg almost getting killed. There is no weight to anything, and it undercuts any attempt at emotion. I'd be genuinely shocked if someone told me they shed a tear while watching this movie, even if the humor lets up at the big climactic moment, though it clearly is trying for some real heart-tugging. I can take a light-hearted movie in the MCU where nothing of vital importance happens, but there are some important plot points, and that's a problem.That's not the only problem with Thor: Love and Thunder, and I could probably go on a full tirade about many of the other issues. However, I will restrain myself and just hit each one like quick bullet points. The handing off of Mjolnir like a loyal pet kind of undermines the magic of the whole ""worthy"" thing established prior to this film. The quick shuffling off of the Guardians of the Galaxy is about as shoddy as Chris Pratt's hair in the film. The whole god convention sequence is atrocious and makes you feel like Gorr has the right idea. Thor has become as shallow and dumb as the version they featured on the What If show. The handing off of Thor's lightning powers to anyone at any time with any weapon makes him look rather selfish in prior films when they could have used a bit of extra help against someone like Thanos. The deus ex machina of the Eternity wish now makes previous plans of people like Thanos and even the Scarlet Witch feel over-complicated when all they needed was a quick trip with Stormbreaker. I'll stop there, but the really sad thing about all this is that it has taken less than 3 years for the MCU to go from a franchise where I couldn't bear to miss a single film, to a franchise where I might just skip out on some movies because the quality has dipped so dramatically."
128,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," Nearly a 2-hour SNL skit:...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) ""comedy.""During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The ""jokes"" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There's too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought...""I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie."" That's not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on."
129,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," Very very disappointed:I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage."
130,Thor: Love and Thunder,5," Bale good  the rest kinda weak.:Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine. It has got to the point where if spending your time aimlessly going through your phone for 2+ hours or watching a marvel movie is a bigger waste of time."
131,Thor: Love and Thunder,5," Too sily  feels like it's own parody:Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies."
132,Thor: Love and Thunder,4, I think 4/10 is generous:I can't be bothered typing an essay so I'll sum up:Thor is reduced to a bumbling idiot to elevate Jane and Valkyrie.Horrible CGI.Jokes that don't land.A plot not worth caring about.Forgettable set pieces.Overuse of Guns N Roses.
133,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," And another franchise destroyed. Disney strikes again.:There are so many things wrong with this film, I'm not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor's costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she's a girl. I guess Queen wasn't good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other ""Thors"" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor's clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive."
134,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," You CAN try to make a movie too funny.:First off let's start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif's arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There's so much of it that it isn't even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going ""can we get on with the movie?"". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The ""serious"" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, ""funny"" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that's one of many reasons it wasn't enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems ""final"".Thor steals Zeus' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn't it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn't they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor ""gives him a beer"" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr's resurrected daughter. It's just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok's mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director."
135,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," Thor: Nepotism and Narcissism. The Family Vanity Venture.:Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil.""Gorr - The God Butcher"", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn't have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi's egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don't interpret this as me ""bashing"" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it's their parents' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: ""Whatever it Takes"".Thor: Love and Thunder: ""Whatever"".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would've made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth's family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I'm not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I'm merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I'm just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I'd ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would've laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10."
136,Thor: Love and Thunder,5," Highly disappointing:This review will come off as very negative, but I had a decent time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022, IMAX 7/20/2022)"
137,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," Thor: Bore and Blunder.:This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions."
138,Thor: Love and Thunder,5, Below Average:The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Zeus is a forgettable character in the movie. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.
139,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," Crash Of A Franchise:Marvel films have never been for a smart audience. But turning a character like Thor and many others into a Clash Of The Titans rom-com really seals the fate of this incarnation of the MCU. There really is nothing new here save for Thors butt, which nobody ever asked for. But serves to show just how low Marvel will go for toilet humor."
140,Thor: Love and Thunder,2, It's a joke:I feel like I've just watched a movie written by a bunch of school kids. They threw everything funny they could think of against the board and literally forgot everything else that makes a good movie. As a result nothing else in this movie means anything...it's a green screen completely detached from reality...
141,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," It's a Joke:Everything is a joke, even when it shouldn't be, leaves the movie itself as ""a joke"" itself.It has too much of that rock guy Korg. A fan edit removing most of Korg will increase the rating by at least a point.Thor gets the stereotypical Homer Simpson treatment. This is apparently the god of thunder. Ugh."
142,Thor: Love and Thunder,2," Who wrote this garbage?:I am at a loss for words, it is childish but not even that. It is actually hard to put this to words.IIt is as if they wanted to try and make this a Comedy but did not even know how to make a Comedy. You know those episodes of your favorite TV shows that they tried to make a musical episode and how cringe it was to watch... Well that is the best way I can describe this.Save your money up for Gas and Groceries and hope Avatar is as good as we all hope."
143,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," Empty. Annoying.:String of jokes and gags. Bland fight sequences. Hollow characters. Candypop colours and bling. Lazy, formulaic BGM. Pointless, absolutely unnecessary. When did Marvel become a spoof of its own material? Even The Powerpuff Girls had more sincerity than Love and Thunder. Waited for two hours to feel SOMETHING. All I felt was a headache and a pair of tired eyes."
144,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," CGI Thursday's...:The Gods of Chore desecrate with poor humour, this must surely be, a Marvel lampooner, while a dark necromancer, a metaphorical cancer, wages war with his shady black tumours. There's a Crowe God takes us to new lows, waffles along with ridiculous prose, but he isn't alone, most of this makes you moan, you're relieved when it gets to the close.Taika Waititi fails to pull another Jo Jo Rabbit out of his increasingly emptying bag, in a film that leaves you groaning and squirming, from the ridiculous to the inept, from the absurd to the disengaging and detaching disconnect. Not sure why Christian Bale presents as Marilyn Manson but it's probably the only thing that works, although possibly not as intended."
145,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," They destroyed Thor:I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough."
146,Thor: Love and Thunder,5," Expectations are a terrible thing..:..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release."
147,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," Boring and unfunny traded tickets for Black Phone:Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I'm shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don't care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be ""politically correct"" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate."
148,Thor: Love and Thunder,3," Really? The longer you watch it  the worse it gets:It is hard to understand how they can so thoroughly mess up a proven franchise, but apparently it is easy to do. The Matrix franchise has done it, and this one has done it. It is sad really.The acting is decent, and actors deliver as much as possible, but it lacks continuity, a rational story and so much more. The atrocity that is Russell Crowe's character and performance is just absurd. Christian Bale is as angst ridden as ever and delivers it well, but what a wasted performance on a nonsensical script.The story is bad, the directing is pretty bad, everything including the music is over the top and absurd.I understand how the screaming goats felt in this film and wanted to scream with them!"
149,Thor: Love and Thunder,1," By very far the worst MCU movie so far.:This movie was just... ridiculous by so many aspects. There are a few, very few great moments, but which are absolutely not enough to save the film from its director, his color frenzy, and all the ridiculous fluff surrounding the story, that generally make the movie fun, enjoyable, more interesting, but in this case seem like repeated and clear attempts to make the audience cringe.The main story in itself had so.freaking.much potential, and they completely wasted it, got completely lost in derision. Seemed like a sarcastic parody of itself... Lame. This one I'm clearly not going to watch again any time soon, if ever...I feel like it needs a 1* just to try and counterbalance the throng of fake votes made on this site to artifically increase the score of that crap."
150,Avatar,," AVATAR REVISITED:I'm not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash 'Avatar'. I know it wasn't when it came out, because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn't get enough of it. In hindsight, I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it; somehow, once the film had become the most successful movie ever (unadjusted for inflation) it stopped being cool to like James Cameron's eco-sci-fi extravaganza.Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story, unoriginal ideas and bland characters, as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados. ""FernGully in space"" or ""Dances With Wolves with blue cat-people"" are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure - which in all honesty I don't get.I mean, it's fine not to like the movie (all art is subjective and all that), but how so many self-professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture - which on Metacritic is rated even higher than 'The Dark Knight' - was nothing but a bland, unoriginal, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the (then) novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me.What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original, director-driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at 'Avatar': an original, director-driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties. ""The ideas in the film are not original"", they claim. Come on guys, seriously?So you've seen a world like Pandora before? A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests? A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness? You've seen many films about a bio-database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors?You've watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco-system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs? And by the way: how many ""eco-sci-fi"" films have you seen? Such a worn-out concept and tired old sub-genre, right?No my friends, in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come, and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons (like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information). But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight-forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci-fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience.To that end, the film uses certain well-known story tropes (""the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy""; ""the soldier who realizes he's been fighting for the wrong cause""; ""the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he's invading"" or the timeless trope of ""the fish out of water""), but they are not what the film is about. And those tropes are not copied from 'Dances With Wolves' either - any more than that film stole them from 'Pocahontas': they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history, from 'Lawrence of Arabia' to 'Shogun' or 'The Last Samurai' and countless others.And yes, our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters (though neither are they as bland as the film's most vicious detractors claim), but that's because they aren't really the film's main focus. 'Avatar's actual protagonist, its true star if you will, is Pandora. It's the WORLD we get to experience through Jake's eyes that really matters here, and the film aims straight for your gut - not your sci-fi nerd brain (which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans - now - claim to be disappointed with the film).More than anything, 'Avatar' wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand-in for our own threatened world, and the film is an unapologetic, uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature - as well as a call to action to preserve them. Which on an emotional level works marvelously: nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree, which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon. It's a genius scene, and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of ""Home Tree"" does in Cameron's film.So again (I'm trying to hammer my point home here ;-), 'Avatar' is simple? Yes, but that's the point: the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate; the themes are not just derivative re-treads, they're as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone. And that's exactly what Cameron's intention was: to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart-felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world. Which, given the film's success, it obviously did.Personally, I think 'Avatar' is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right, and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness. And while this may only have been my own individual experience, 'Avatar' was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater - which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D. It was also the last time a film managed to do that.And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular. It's a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top-notch CGI, filled with fascinating creatures and jaw-dropping future-tech, and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out, non-stop sci-fi action thrill-ride on a scale the world had rarely - if ever - seen before.Obviously that doesn't mean it's a perfect film, and as I already pointed out, it's fair not to like it for any number of reasons (above all: personal taste), but 'Avatar' is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days. Get over it people: simple doesn't equal simplistic, and the fact that 'Avatar' is neither subtle nor cynical doesn't make it dumb (even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed ;-).In all honesty, I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film - instead of the most successful movie of all time - many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci-fi adventure classic for the ages. And as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what 'Avatar' is: a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur. Rant over."
151,Avatar,10," It's an experience! A magical one.:I was waiting for this day for the longest time. I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released. So never got to watch it back then. But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away! This is nothing short of a masterpiece! It's beyond belief how a film like this could've been made. Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget. I'm definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough.Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art!"
152,Avatar,10, A NEW WORLD.....:Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I've never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That's why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don't miss this one on the big screen if you haven't seen it. It's a total new world experience. Can't wait for the PART 2....
153,Avatar,9," Cameron Returns:Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back."
154,Avatar,8," One of the best cinematic experiences ever...:Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***½/****"
155,Avatar,," Technically impressive and important but beyond that there is not a huge amount to talk about:Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me – particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first ""big"" film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The ""look it's in 3D"" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about ""how did they do that shot"" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as ""Unobtainium"" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is ""so-so"", Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these."
156,Avatar,6," Visually mind-blowing  but lacking in the story:I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as ""Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichéd, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
157,Avatar,6," Looks great  I just wish I cared what happened in it:""Avatar"" is not the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings."" It might be the next ""Matrix,"" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next ""Matrix Revolutions."" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after ""Return of the King."" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the ""Na'vi,"" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Heck, even ""Dead Man."" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, ""we have to fight terror with terror."" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about ""Star Wars"" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember ""Jake Sully."" 6/10"
158,Avatar,9," Incredible scope and spectacle:A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10"
159,Avatar,9," The best blockbuster in years - the master is back!:It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity – a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake's (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience – not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D – which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG – something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek's Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back!"

161,Avatar,10," Best movie experience of the last 30 years...:I was lucky to see Avatar at a pre-screening a few hours ago. It completely blew me and the whole room away and i dare to say it will do so to 80% of any audience anywhere. The remaining 20%, who always finds something to complain about, will whine about character development, dialog, story or the pop-corn.Well, let me tell you: they went to this movie with the wrong expectations.You have most likely met Cameron's previous work(s): Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic (!), just to name a few.So WHAT should you expect from Avatar??? MORE of the same!!! More of revolutionary film-making, more of grandiose new ideas, more of never-before-seen special effects, more of 150 minutes without relapsing, more of the James Cameron genius...I am very happy that the trailers didn't give the full story away. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also. Cameron was very smart keeping the teasers as teasers, nothing more... as the full movie will take your breath away.You will practically not notice that you are watching a non-existing world, it is sooo real. Attention to detail is superb. You computer geeks will know what I am talking about. This move was not rushed in the making. No wonder it could not have been done before - not having the proper computing power.The wild life, the jungle, the animals, the Na'vi-s, or the dragon-like flying creatures are all so life-like, they almost pop-off the screen (and in 3D they actually do :) .The sound effects were so well done, that when I saw at the credits that Skywalker Sound was behind it, i could only think of ""yessss... now THAT makes sense.""Cameron is a visionaire - and again, he delivers, with full blast.A certain character says in the movie that Pandora (the planet where the story takes place) became his real world. My advice to you: let Pandora become YOUR real world for two and a half hours, let it make you completely forget about your life and problems, let it entertain you, move you, let it carry you away.Because THAT is what i expect as an exchange for my ticket.And a few hours ago i got tens of tickets worth of that."
162,Avatar,10," James Cameron  welcome back!:You wanna know something funny? Not even a year ago, early 2009, I was watching ""The Directors"" on the Reelz Channel and James Cameron was on. I was talking to my friend and saying how he is one of my favorite directors, he has an amazing track record of great movies, but wait, has he done anything since Titanic? I went on the net to check to see what he has done since Titanic and it says nothing but documentaries and he was working on a film called Avatar. I read a little about the movie and then a few months later came the trailer and I was just in awe. I was extremely curious to see this movie and couldn't wait as when we hear the name James Cameron, you can't help but expect nothing but greatness. The man is a perfectionist and it shows, he always goes above and beyond what he needs to do for a film and we got that with Avatar. My only complaint being like Titanic, the story not being the most original on the market, but I can't at all hate this movie. Originally wanting give this movie a 9 rating, I find myself thinking that I can't. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen in my life. My boyfriend and I saw this in 3D and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. James Cameron is back and I hope he never leaves Hollywood again as this was the breath of fresh air that we needed with Avatar.In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and use gas masks. In an attempt to improve relations with the natives, scientists create human-Na'vi hybrids called avatars, controlled by genetically-matched human operators. Jake Sully, a former marine, becomes a last-minute replacement for his murdered identical twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator. Dr. Grace Augustine, the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother, and relegates him to a bodyguard role. Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman on an exploratory mission in their avatar forms to make contact with the Na'vi in order to help establish diplomatic relations, solve the problem of resources and end the threat of violence. The group is attacked by a predator, and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's dangerous jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by Neytiri's clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at, the Na'vi shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior ""Dream-walker"", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways.I had another fellow IMDb user e-mail me a week ago asking me about my thoughts on the movie and he informed me that Cameron has been working on the story for years(many thanks to oldman007 for the info) and just now had the opportunity to work on it. I think that Cameron did a great thing by taking a break from movies as not only could he retire a good 25 times from the money he made on Titanic but we had an opportunity to appreciate him even more for Avatar. 2009 was kind of a lousy year for films and this was the movie that we needed to have that sigh of relief. From the actors, the special effects, the visuals, and the way the story is told was orchestrated like a perfect night at the theater with an standing ovation from the audience as everyone wanted more despite the 150 minute running time.I'm sure Avatar is sure to be in for the run during Oscar time, wither it gets a best picture nod or not, I'm not sure, but from what I've seen this does deserve every award it can get. I feel very bad if I'm over hyping the film too much for you, I don't want people to get the wrong idea that this is the Casablanca of the new millennium, but it really was just a relief that we still have potential in Hollywood to put out a great movie. Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana stole the show and I think the reason being is because Cameron can make females very strong, beautiful, but doesn't over do it with his actresses and always knows what he wants from them and they deliver. Sam Worthington as the leading man, Jake, I was a bit worried as I saw Terminator: Salvation which was like spitting in James Cameron's face, he was the star in that film too and I thought he was going to just suck the life out of this film. Thankfully I was wrong and he pulled in a strong enough performance to carry the film with some incredible actors beside him. Avatar is very much worth the look on the big screen, it's a masterpiece.10/10"
163,Avatar,10," Avatar is a masterpiece & a breakthrough in cinema:It was Terminator in the 1980's and then Titanic in the '90s and it's definitely Avatar in the 2000s!! James Cameron is my most favourite director and he has once again broken all boundaries and created a visual extravaganza.Avatar is Cameron's latest magnum opus is probably one of the most anticipated movies since Titanic and now it seems that the visionary director has indeed created a film that'll revolutionise the world of cinema.The movie is set in the year 2154 and is about a man called Jake who can't walk and he is selected in the Avatar program where he has to go to Pandora jungle which is not a planet but it is one of the three giant gasses that is about 4 light years away from earth. On Pandora there are life forms such as the navis that are about 10 feet tall have sparkly blue skin, big eyes and tails. The humans have genetically bred human-navi hybrids known as Avatars. Jake is able to walk but falls in love with a female navi and now he has to choose the side between humans or the navis.The film was absolutely fascinating, interesting, entertaining and emotional. I loved the look on the Pandora jungle and it must be the best scenery in film history and the navis are definitely the best digital characters since Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The special effects are so amazing that Pandora looks like a real location and you can mistake the navis as real characters. Avatar was almost 3 hours but it didn't seem that long. Avatar already makes it on my top 5 favourite movies and I intend to see it again and I am already waiting for it to release on Blu Ray because I'm sure that it will be one of the best Blu Ray titles."
164,Avatar,6," Mr so-called ""King of the World"" returns with a visually dazzling spectacle and so-so story:James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying."
165,Avatar,5," Incredible  inventive effects can't save this:James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by ""aliens"" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw."
166,Avatar,8," Visually Spellbinding!:I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local ""Event Cinema"" BCC in 3DNow this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi's faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...So for those of you who have not seen this yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!5/5"
167,Avatar,10," When Lighting Strikes:James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better, and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production, the marvelous and wonderful ""Avatar"", a film with non stop energy that entertains, teaches, and delights us. Though not completely original, the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screen.""Avatar"" is the story of the conflicts between two worlds, one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit, and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight. As we are introduced to the wonders of Pandora, an ironic name if any, the wonders begin. Cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination, with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes, fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous CGI creatures, come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""King Kong"", but the new animals show more force and agility, and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to be.The crowning jewel are the humanoids native to Pandora, tall and proud blue skinned beings, lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast. A million years ahead of the work done with similar process by Zemeckis in the disturbing ""Polar Express"" and ""Christmas Carol"", the people from Pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently, and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak. Most incredible work is done by Worthington and Saldana, as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each other.Humand eventually try to encroach over the people of Pandora's natural resources, by any means necessary, and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives' spirits. These are powerful scenes, full of an intensity rarely seen in epic/fantasy films, and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by Scott in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and Stone's ""Alexander"", a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element, spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination, and the results are magnificent.Finally, I can't heap enough praise upon this sensation movie, the best of 2009, one that is as powerful as ""Departures"", as imaginative and entertaining as ""Star Trek"", full of some of the wonder of ""Up"", and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of Robin Williams in the ""World's Greatest Dad"" and Jessica Biel's and Kristin Scott-Thomas in ""Easy Virtue"", films that like ""Avatar"" are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power. How does one know that a film will become a classic? When one leave the theatre and can't wait to see it again for the sum of its parts, not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film, or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold. Cameron has made sure ""Avatar""'s separate parts all work in tune, from its performances, to its screenplay, to its editing, and special effects, never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us. A great film."
168,Avatar,4," Colourful Visuals . Black And White Storytelling:I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised "" A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc "" . I'm one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering . On top of that I'm not someone who's going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses . It's bad enough being a speccy in real life . Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades ? In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at all In April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I'd seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR . Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you're able to concentrate on the story . The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there's nothing happening at allFault number one - there's very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie . Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white . Good guys ( Read humans ) are blacker than the darkest night while good guys ( Read blue skinned aliens ) are so white they're brighter than the sun itself. It's almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies . I say "" almost "" because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will . There is no complexity involved what so ever . The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there's no motives involved . Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn't a 3D gimmick and had saving graces . Take away the 3D and you'll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool . Also nice to know it was stuffed at the Oscars by the cheap and compelling tiny budget THE HURT LOCKER"
169,Avatar,5," Even if it is sporadically decent or fun  it's mostly a bore:A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look ""photo-realistic"", as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness."
170,Avatar,," Don't Miss AVATAR at any cost. It'll be years before we have a movie experience like this again.:12 years ago, James Cameron had a vision of Avatar in mind. A vision so ahead of its time that Cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up. A vision so imaginative & exciting that he, finally, went on to create the much needed technology on his own. And the end result was NOT disappointing at all. Avatar takes film-making technology to a whole new level & sets a new standard in 3D viewing. It's a milestone in the history of the art.Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders & protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism & biodiversity. Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. So, watch it in 3D cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of Cameron's world.Director James Cameron has, once again, broken all boundaries & created a visual extravaganza, thus, in the process, announcing his return which just couldn't have been better. From Terminator to Aliens to The Abyss to Terminator 2 to Titanic & now Avatar, the entertainment scope is getting wider & wider with every Cameron's film without compromising at all with the quality. The attention he has given to the detail is superb. Not only Cameron created a whole new world with its flora & fauna of exceptional beauty, he went on to create the culture, race & language of the Na'vi too & their love for their surroundings. They are to Pandora what humans are to Earth. Only difference being our ignorance to our surroundings.Avatar isn't an exceptional movie, overall. When it comes to plot, performances or dialogs, its a disappointment. Those things are no match to Cameron's previous works; Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2 & even Titanic. The reason behind Avatar breaking every box-office records lies in the beauty of Avatar that's drawing people to theaters again & again. The unforgettable experience in 3D viewing, the dead-end beauty of Pandora, the never-seen-before film-making technology & much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success. It has started the change. It has set things in motion. Cinema is getting revolutionized. Almost every movie is going 3D these days because of Avatar. Still, none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience. That's why, Avatar is way ahead of it's time.Now, let's come to the strong points of Avatar. It lies in its visual effects, editing & cinematography. Editing, like any Cameron movie, is brilliant. The cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment, the exotic creatures & incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora. Those who watched it in 3D knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora & fauna of Pandora. However, the backbone of Avatar is its visual effects. Groundbreaking from scene 1, it's not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which Visual Effects of Avatar reached new heights. World's 2 greatest visual effects studios, ILM & Weta Digital, worked together to produce this gem, and the results are wonderful. The attention in detailing & the magnitude scale of Pandora are sure to leave viewers jaw-dropped. Just the detailing on the face of a Na'vi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its making.Technically, Avatar is a breakthrough in film-making technology, 3D viewing & stereoscopic film-making with camera being designed specifically for the movie. If one looks at the story, it isn't that bad too. Of course not the best or even among the best, but still, it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world & that's what this movie is doing right now. At least, James Cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie, unlike Michael Bay(Transformers 1 n 2) or Roland Emmerich(2012, Godzilla etc) who rely only on VFX & nothing else. At least, Avatar scores pretty well above them. It tells a fine story & let VFX n SFX take this movie to new heights.James Horner collaborated with James Cameron for the 3rd time (after Titanic & Aliens) & no doubt, has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again. The score is not as epic as Titanic but is still excellent for a sci-fi film. The score is really beautiful & succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race. The beauty of the music of Avatar blends well with the beauty of Pandora. James Horner has done a fantastic job.Also, the story or screenplay of Avatar won't make it to the great lists. So, its better you go without expecting a quality plot & screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes. And make sure you watch Avatar in 3D for an all new experience. You won't regret it. Missing Avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema. So be a part of it.10/10 for Avatar's beauty & the wonderful experience I had in theater."
171,Avatar,10," Fascinating concept .Must be seen cannot be described:I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film."
172,Avatar,1," People are weak minded.:First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.Storywise, there is no story at all. It's the typical good vs bad scenario shaped out of cowboys against indians in space mixing it with a yogi everything connects us to the world impression plus a goddamn planet called Pandora and looks like f...in' paradise. Lot's of shiny colours and huge monsters who eat flesh are your best friends. Come on. You gotta be kidding me.Maybe I might be the only one here, cause all reviews I've seen got great score, but that is not what a movie is supposed to be. I was very unimpressed by the CGI and the artistic development because I might be used to computer games such as Final Fantasy series which has been the shaper of such incredible stories, only that these games have a very strong story to tell and and you feel totally involved.It impresses me that people give this such a high rating because of it's visuals. I mean it was clear that sooner or later a movie would appear with such incredible CGI. If it wouldn't have been Avatar another would have been the winner.I am sad that nowadays cinema is ail centered only about violence, good looks and a huge lack of brain.3 out of ten only for the cgi which I thought is not the center of a movie otherwise I would have rated it beneath 0."
173,Avatar,1," The most overrated film in history:The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it.

This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.1 star out of 4"
174,Avatar,8," A Movie With Too Much Hate That Deserves More Appreciation:Over the years James Cameron's, Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it groundbreaking and a masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn't kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav'i look incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes. I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though similar to others) is like nothing I've ever seen before. 89%-A-"
175,Morbius,3," I'm BEGGING you  please make Rated R movies:Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: ""The action was gibberish."" You couldn't see anything.I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be ""a good guy,"" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have to ask, what were they thinking?"
176,Morbius,3," An absolute mess:Morbius is one of those rare films that pretty much gets everything wrong.The story, the character development, the action... everything about it felt very dated and messy, with practically no redeeming qualities to be found anywhere.There was no depth to any of the characters which made it so hard to get invested in what was going on. In truth I don't think any of the performances were bad per se, but they were all so bland.It didn't help the characters that the writing was so poor. They had no faith in the audience at all, spoon feeding us exposition in the most clunky ways imaginable.The action was truly dreadful. It was either in super slow-mo which exposed the poor CGI, or it was at super speed to the point you were just watching blurs.The story was so basic and formulaic. I hate to say it but I was actually bored watching it. The pacing also felt very off, as the film came to a very abrupt end, before subjecting us to some bonkers credits scenes.I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive bad action. I can forgive a weak plot. But there is one thing in a film I can't forgive and that is when it leaves me bored. As a result Morbius scores a measly 3/10."
177,Morbius,6," Simple start...:""Morbius"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Morbius"" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed."
178,Morbius,7," Turned out to be rather enjoyable...:I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching ""Morbius"" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless managed to put together a fair enough storyline. I will say that it was aimed more at an audience fully and wholly unfamiliar with the Michael Morbius character. And I can understand that approach to the first movie with the character, as to introduce a whole new audience of viewers to the character, and not go in on the deep end and do fan service to us whom have been reading the comic books for years.Personally I had hoped for a bit more in terms of story, but it was actually adequate enough in terms of entertainment. An origin story for a character new to the cinema screen is in its place, I suppose.I was also somewhat hesitant about it being Jared Leto to don the mantle of the living vampire, given the swing and miss performance of Joker in the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"", but then again he was amazing in the 2000 movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". Thankfully, then his performance as Michael Morbius was quite good and actually was suitable for the character from the comic books.Visually then you are in for quite a treat, given the fact that this is a Marvel movie. The CGI and special effects are quite impressive in the movie, as they are in all Marvel movies. So if you enjoy flashy CGI and special effects, then ""Morbius"" doesn't disappoint.All in all, then I will say that I was more than adequately entertained by the 2022 movie ""Morbius"", though I had hoped for a bit more in the story department. But hopefully the future will add more layers to the character and his story.My rating of director Daniel Espinosa's 2022 movie lands on a seven out of ten stars."
179,Morbius,6," Overdone CGI and editing aside- I enjoyed this one:Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10."
180,Morbius,5," Morbius truly is a film:Morbius truly has to be one of the films released in 2022 so far.Jared Leto did a job playing Morbius and the action was in the film. The film has storytelling and the CGI was animated. The side characters were along with morbius and the villain was a bad guy. The jokes were sentences. This film really is one of the films of all time, if not the last decade."
181,Morbius,6," Morbius:6/10 - I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didn't love the visual design of the vampires, I thought the cinematography, VFX, sound design, and Adria Arjona (who is now on my ""Actors to Watch"" list) really elevated the relatively weak story."
182,Morbius,5," Snore-bius:Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed.Will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges.....You know when a studio knows that a film may be in trouble, when they plaster the Marvel name everywhere on the poster, just in case nobody knows who Möbius is. And this film is a lot of trouble.It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that Möbius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, Möbius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while."
183,Morbius,3," A profoundly bad movie. Sony is 100% guilty of false advertising. Early review.:This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony."
184,Morbius,8," Its a Decent movie!:The pacing is tight and the action was awesome, the colors effects while in a fight was looking amazing, the story was decent as a origin, The 1st half was good although the final act the last 30mins were little meh, the villian's suddenly gone rogue was little odd felt like it just happened and the Nurse's stuff felt lost at the end with it the post credits just didn't make no sense considering the man morbious was. Overall 1st half was good and the ending felt little mess although its a part entertaining and a decent watch."
185,Morbius,7," People need to learn to enjoy movies without comparing them:This is not your favourite huge budget Marvel movie like No Way Home, this is a introductory film of a somewhat niche character and if you compare any comic film to something like No Way Home it will fall flat. I went into this with an open mind and I had an enjoyable time. It's a different type of Marvel film with dark humour and I enjoyed myself while watching it. I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles. I think if you are able to enjoy a film without nitpicking at it then you'll have fun with this."
186,Morbius,2," Venom doesn't seem too bad now:No surprises this was awful. Jared Leto is terrible and Matt Smith was annoying. CGI was laughingly bad and the slow-mo action and wonky editing made things borderline unwatchable. Writing was all over the place too with some terrible dialogue. There's little fun and it took itself way too seriously. Honestly, this made Venom seem alright in comparison.2/10."
187,Morbius,3," ""I... am... Venom""? Movie  just because you aim low doesn't mean you can reach it  not if you're gonna put in this little effort:Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.I am at this point slightly concerned that I may have made this sound more interesting, complex, and unconventional, than it actually is. In a lot of ways this feels like it should have come out 15 to 20 years ago. It's been in development for that amount of time, so maybe they just didn't do that much to change it anytime recently, to keep it up-to-date, since this is a subgenre that has evolved tremendously in that time? Without a doubt if this had come out one to two decades ago, we would be looking at it as a product of its time, rather than something that is completely out of date. It still wouldn't be good. Not even close. But we'd be going easier on it than we, rightfully, are now.Clearly Matt Smith is enjoying himself. And his enthusiasm is infectious. For a while I was thinking, ""it doesn't really fit with the rest of what's on screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over the place"". And then he started doing that literally. On more than one occasion. In separate scenes. The action is decent, although the meh, and at times possibly unfinished, special effects do make it harder to make out. This was clearly trimmed down, and a lot of the things we were excited about from the trailers are either majorly altered or a scene that is now just a clip with narration.I recommend this to those who miss the bad old days of the first Ghost Rider flick. 3/10."
188,Morbius,8," Not great  but I liked it more than The Eternals:Michael Morbius(Jared Leto) a doctor who is slowly dying from a rare blood disease, struggles to find a cure, when he thinks he has, but things work a little too well, until he discovers there's more supernatural to it, then he could have imagined.It was entertaining, but to much feels taken out, like it was supposed to be R rated, but they decided at the last minute decided to take out most of the violence in order to get a PG 13. Everybody plays there roles pretty well. Jared Leto does alright has Morbius, but the film itself is pretty cliched, but still fun and entertaining, and if that is all you want then Morbius does deliver."
189,Morbius,1," A toothless and inept Marvel offering:Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
190,Morbius,1, No blood?:A vampire film without blood. That says it all. And it clearly shows that the film has been poorly thought since the start. Not to mention that the character is probably one of the most unknown and uninteresting comic book characters.
191,Morbius,7, Bloodless  okay action  and could be worse.:3.5 out of 5 stars.Morbius is a pretty fair superhero film that may be thin on plot and decent action sequences. It does add an entertaining adaptation bringing in another character that is supposedly a Spider man villain. May not be as fun as the Venom movies. Jared Leto does a great job playing a sick Dr. Michael Morbius. Who is on a desperate search for a cure from his blood borne illness. Which one will be leading him into becoming a vampire. Adria Arjona also did great playing his love interest. Matt Smith is a bit flat with his character and also playing a villain that is one dimensional and forgettable. Jared Harris playing as Morbius mentor is also thin with his character. Along with Tyrese Gibson which the script did not give these characters anything more besides be on the hunt for Morbius.The film is very fast paced. And the script does not give much character development with any of the supporting characters besides Michael and Martine (Adria Arjona). The plot is thin and may not be as strong. The action sequences were okay. With the fast movements with the characters and editing which makes the scenes more of a chore to see than increase the entertainment value.If your looking for a quick superhero escapism in the theatres this film will be great. The direction did not do anything new to make it stand out compared to any other superhero films. There is a mid credit scene to give you a hint on where this character will be placed in the universe. The film is not great but still delivers some entertainment.
192,Morbius,10, M O R B I N G U S:Morbiges is a truly life changing movie its 2 hours of cgi jared leto flying about doing nothing to further the plot however morbenguser manages to encircle the viewer in the great cinematic experience. Overall morbinjuicy is a 10/10 greatest movie ever.
193,Morbius,7," Well Worth A Watch:MorbiusOverall it was GoodI expected so much more but basically it was an origin story for a vampire. Well get real how many vampire movies have I seen, from Dracula to Twilight and What They Do In The Shadows, I know every nuance about vampire life, and yet here the movie presumed we knew nothing.Just as the movie was starting to flag in came adult Milo, played by Matt Smith, he dominated the screen and the stark contrast between the method style of acting and Thespianism could not have been more noticeable. It was great!To me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the charisma, he was proficient in this role but nothing more than that!I really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared, moved, flew, glided and transformed the rest was unremarkable.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10, it was well worth a watch even if in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story."
194,Morbius,7, Morbius is another interesting yet scattered offering from the Sony-verse that delves into the more horror aspects of this anti hero.:Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.
195,Morbius,7, Better Than Expected:From all the bad press and reviews I suspect that people were looking for more then it intended to be. Seeing it for free on Netflix might have dampened the pain. This is not an MCU movie. It's trying to be one in the Underworld flair. Maybe too much Underworld. One of the problems is that Jared Leto cannot carry a movie. He needs a stronger lead to work off of. When he has that he's more than enough. The subtlety of the effects works for me. The bad guy Milo was a little too one dimensional and flat. Predictable. Weak writing in that regard. Not enough character development. I can see Morbius working in an ensemble MCU cast. Hopefully he will be given that chance.
196,Morbius,7," This is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one  much like the Venom movies:Morbius (2022) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a doctor with a rare blood disease that is in his final days. Him and his childhood friend do their best to cope with being on their death bed. When the doctor has a breakthrough he discovers the cure is as much a curse as a gift...that doesn't prevent his friend from wanting a taste. Can Morbius find a way to save him and his friend and modify his cure or will his friend get his hands on the cure and cause all new problems?This movie is directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) and stars Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream), Matt Smith (The Crown), Jared Harris (Mad Men), Adria Arjona (Pacific Rim: Uprising), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy) and Al Madrigal (The Way Back).The storyline for this picture is very well told with great character backstories and evolution. You can easily find yourself rooting and relating to both the good and bad guy. The action scenes are excellent and very well done. The opening boat scene really sets the tone for the movie. I liked the ""smoke"" effects around the characters and there's lots of solid kill sequences and use of blood. I did wish they kicked the gore up another level but that's more of a preference, especially when there's so many kills. I'd also say I wasn't a huge fan of how the ending was executed in the final fight. They did do a good job of tying in the multiverse to keep you aligned on when and where this takes place.Overall this is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one, much like the Venom movies. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once."
197,Morbius,7, This movie does not deserve a 4.8:This movie is definitely not as bad as the critics have rated it. It's nothing amazing but it's not horrible either. Storyline was very predictable but far better then most cheesy crap that comes out. I'd give it a 6.5 nothing amazing but slightly better then average.
198,Morbius,3," Nope:Bad. Bad plot, bad character development, bad pace, bad cinematography, bad fights, no emotional connection, no stakes, not confident.Leto and Smith try their best but there is not a lot to work with here. 2 good scenes, back to back (hospital and prison), not fantastic, but at least were kind of cool and let you interested, hoping for the best. The best never came."
199,Morbius,6," Bat Man:Someone on BBC1 asked Jared Leto about this, but I had it in mind before. And I think the Bat Man joke is too obvious to be missed out on. And that he is being played by a guy who also portrayed the Joker.That aside, I can see that some people don't like the movie. The CGI isn't that good - especially considering the budget this must have had. There is also a dance (by the main villain) that reminds us of the bad dance by Tobey Maguire in Spiderman 3 ... also as cringeworthy as the one from back then. We then also get a Kayser Soze moment. Well not as iconic as the one from the Usual Suspects ... but it still is there.We have a lot of scary faces, but not a lot of blood. Considering the violence and the death that are occuring ... this does not display them as visual as it could. But if it did, this wouldn't have gotten a PG-13 now would it? While this is a Marvel character, it is owned by Sony .. but as you may be aware there are other things that seem to get .. into the mix. One of them has an appearance during the credits ... in two scenes. No scene after the credits .. but those two scenes suggest something that Jared Leto has already hinted at himself ... an new Universe is building ... well if the powers to be and the box office allows them to.Not a bad movie overall, but lacking a few things, even though the actors and the cinematography are not to be blamed (the latter has some bad moments especially during the last fight, where I couldn't tell where up and down was) ... sound was amazing, but I watched it in an Atmos cinema, so there's that. Very flawed but not as bad as some probably think it is ... it is an origin story and is quite stale pace wise ... but it is what it is."
200,Interstellar,10," Out of this world:A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."
201,Interstellar,10," A visual and auditory marvel:Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
202,Interstellar,10," I waited 5 years to watch it again:After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again
This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
203,Interstellar,10," Masterpiece:Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing."
204,Interstellar,9," A journey across the galaxy to save humanity:Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic."
205,Interstellar,9," Absolutely Brilliant:A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics."
206,Interstellar,10," Excellent Movie:I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
207,Interstellar,10," I would rate 11/10:I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
208,Interstellar,10, Masterpiece:A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.
209,Interstellar,10," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece:Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending."
210,Interstellar,," A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic:I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
211,Interstellar,9," An Emotional  Beautiful Journey into the Unknown:(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
212,Interstellar,10," 7 years later:Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant."
213,Interstellar,10," Fascinating Film:The earth is plagued with droughts, famines and other apocalyptic disasters. Mankind must find a way to leave planet earth once and for all. An earth-like planet has been discovered in another solar system. A spaceship can travel fast through a wormhole though interstellar space but can Cooper get there and return to earth in time to see his daughter before she grows too old?The Aging of Murph vs her father Cooper the answer is relativity playing a factor in aging - how fast time runs depend on the relative position of the observer and the subject.Incredible movie - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!10/10"
214,Interstellar,8," Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best:To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot."
215,Interstellar,10," Greatest movie of all time:I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. Perfection. Mind-blowing. A workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. Amazingly unbelievably awesome, this is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. Lots of amazing scenes with epic music. A killer story told flawlessly. Perfect directing by the best ever. Great cast with great acting. A deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.The most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time. I keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling. (9 viewings, 12/2/16, 2/26/2020, 1/11/2022)SPOILERSI was randomly thinking about interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. I thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. If plan B was what ""originally"" happened and Dr. Brand survived, future people figured it out, and they want to save those they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = Cooper and Murph. Doctor Brand knows this because she knows cooper loves her, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows his daughter grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future people put the machine in the same black hole that cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. Will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, I like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory I had about the ""original"" mission being completed without cooper.Lots of awesome concepts that made me think, like murphy's law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. The robots were cool and original. Really awesome visuals of things I've wondered about but never really imagined. I liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughter's room. The way everything connected was very awesome. The different planets were so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. The endings were perfect.Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time was the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his son, Jesse. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother.The relationship between the father and daughter was the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie was the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needed to save the world.From Interstellar group chat discussion:-Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work-So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people off earth. She found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste . That should break a person. Murph is a beast.-The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data.12/2/16: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without Cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get Cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann backstabbed humanity. It actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmund's planet which was the right one. In that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet."
216,Interstellar,10," Possibly the best movie of all time:I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust..."
217,Interstellar,10," Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey:The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
218,Interstellar,10," I've never seen a movie so good in a long time:This movie is no doubt the best I've ever scene this movie gives you everything emotions,love,hype,excitement,etc..
In my opinion this is the best movie made by Christopher nolan. The ending is so good that I had to watch it twice I loved this movie so much and tbh I don't think any movie will Top this one for me ."
219,Interstellar,10," time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece:chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
220,Interstellar,9," Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative:Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."
221,Interstellar,10," Best movie I have seen in my life:This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
222,Interstellar,9," Stunning sci-fi !:Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years."
223,Interstellar,10," Glad i didn't watch the trailer:Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
224,Interstellar,10," Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark:Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

225,Oblivion,8," Oblivion is  personally  one of my favourite modern sci-fi films.:Honestly, I do believe this is supremely underrated. Now I know I will be in the minority with my opinion, and that's perfectly fine. After all, I gave ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" a solid nine (loooove it). Anyway, in a ravaged and desolate futuristic Earth a tech team are stationed on the planet to ensure hydro rigs are fully operational before being sent to Titan where humanity currently resides. However, they must battle against ""Scavengers"" who set out to destroy these rigs and droids. Why? What could possibly be the reason? Well...stay away from the hideous trailer, unfortunately it reveals far too much. So aside from the hideous marketing, this film is incredible. I've seen it a good twenty times and never get bored. Again, I know most of you will disagree with me...but all the ingredients for a thinking sci-fi are there and unequivocally are blended to make a memorable film. This is two for two for director Joseph Kosinski as far as I'm concerned. ""Tron: Legacy"" is a personal favourite, and so is this. He makes visual audio experiences. The visual effects here are gorgeous, from the clean white architecture to the desolate horizon. Everything looked outstanding, particularly the interior of 'The Tet'. Then we come to M83's soundtrack which is an entrancing piece of synthesised electronic goodness. The two technical aspects compliment each other so well to create, not just a film, but an experience. You guys know me by now, I will always have a soft spot for technically accomplished films. The acting is slightly monotonous, but it works for the environment that they are in. Andrea Riseborough is a personal favourite of mine, she's damn good in everything. The story has plenty of twists and turns, particularly when breaching the Radiation Zone. A few scenes of exposition and narration but not enough to become a detriment to the narrative. Like I said, I'm in the minority...and I don't care, I love this film."
226,Oblivion,9," ""I am Jack Harper and I am Home"":For decades it has been an accepted fact of life in Hollywood that, no matter how good the movie, endings are a write-off.Hollywood has learned the hard way that, no matter how good the film (or the book on which it is based) it is impossible to do an ending which satisfies the writer, the director, the producers, the critics, the audience and (duh!) reviewers like this one.That is why, for literally as long as there have been movies, endings are changed at the last minute; and often even multiple endings are shot so that survey groups can be brought in to make the final choice.The reason I gave this brief lecture on the importance of endings is simple -- going into the last 20 minutes, this was a rock solid film with a rock solid script and rock solid performances.But the ending was ... perfect.And perfect endings are so rare these days that I needed to write a review for posterity that does nothing except note this for future readers and future viewers.Are we still an effective team???????????"
227,Oblivion,10," Don't know why this movie didn't make it:I have now watched this movie 3 times, and each time have liked it more than I did the first time, and even then I still enjoyed it a lot. I look at the litany of trash on the screen that DOES make a profit and am dismayed that this one was so unsuccessful. First, it's a GORGEOUS movie, and it definitely has a beating heart. I found the acting quite good, the story involving, and was quite moved more than once. And the technical staff was amazing! I suspect that it will do well on home video and cable and that one day we'll look back on it and wonder why in the world it did so poorly in its initial run. I applaud director Kosinsky and his fine team of actors and the legion of other professionals involved in bringing this to the screen. I REALLY enjoyed this movie!31Jan14: Months later and I've watched it at least once more from my Blu-ray plus find it almost impossible to NOT watch it when I stumble across it on HBO, and I continue to find it absorbing and I STILL can't watch the end of it without crying! I find it embarrassing to write this, but I think I love this movie."
228,Oblivion,10," If you like Sci Fi  you'll love this!:I hadn't really heard of Oblivion before I watched it, but I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise and his films, as he is such an excellent actor. Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.The characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.The special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.As I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.The overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.It's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!"
229,Oblivion,8," A memorable sci-fi fantasy world with a human heart at its core.:If there is a soul, it is made from the love we share. There are many ways to describe Oblivion, but the softly spoken afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human heartbeat of this sci-fi epic. As always, the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny, I found much to enjoy from Cruise, Riseborough, Freeman and that Nordic guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screen-time, Morgan and other supporting cast are effective and memorable. The threads of the plot are well-woven and I won't give anything away, so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a backseat for sci-fi philosophy with twists to spare. Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely abysmal offerings of 2013 so far, don't miss it."
230,Oblivion,9," As entertainment  brilliant....:I went to see this having read a few reviews, I also heard a review from a friend that Richard Wilkins on Australian critic had said it wasn't that good. Well, I have no idea what film they saw, but it wasn't the one I saw. The start was a little slow, but still threw in some moments of concern to keep one on the edge. As the film settled on, it kept moving at a good pace. Story was a basic love story, mixed in with morality, but basically, love story. Cgi was amazing, cinematography was brilliant, stunning even. All the main characters were easy on the eye too, always making it easier to want to watch. Plot wasn't sophisticated, probably described as feel good, but frankly, it was perfect. I left a 2 hour film and wasn't bored for a second. Cruise, for all the press on him and his supposed kookiness, I don't care, he carried the film..... GO SEE THIS, pure entertainment."
231,Oblivion,8," naysayers are right  but I still liked it:Reading through the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing with the negative reviews in one sense, but still disagreeing overall. I walked away quite liking this movie.Most of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.Re stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.For me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.Given that theme, the movie's style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.Be careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.But still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.Sure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.To me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.But that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.Plus the drones looked really really cool.Re copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.I think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews."
232,Oblivion,9," Oblivion movie review- beautiful  stylish  fantastic:Granted Oblivion takes inspiration from countless sci-fi classics,  granted that it lets a larger than life star consume it, granted it  lets visual flair and elegance triumph mind bending probabilities, but  there is no denying the fact that it is one hell of an entertainer, and  probably THE sci-fi vehicle that Tom Cruise wanted all his life,  Spielberg aside.  A long preamble sets the dystopian background- it is the year 2077, and  the earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the  moon, thus destabilizing the earth, causing earthquakes and tsunamis.  Nuclear annihilation followed, and as the earth became inhabitable, the  surviving humans moved to Titan, a moon of Saturn, while alien  scavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the  earth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by  drones, which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a  stylish, minimalistic floating facility in the clouds, with wiped out  memories- Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea  Riseborough), who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is  this the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have  haunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won  the war?  ""Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you  never lived?""  Oblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I am  legend, Independence Day, @Moon, Star Wars, Total Recall, The Matrix  and of course, WALLE to create a striking, visually resplendent  feature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi (film), Claudio Miranda  creates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and  visual effects- an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked  with craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it, and lush,  unspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective, not  overpowering, and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt  with. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters, a  dreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence, taking direct  inspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As  revelations unravel, he gets into superstar mode with minimal  fussiness- cool vehicles, check. Weapons, check. Beautiful babes,  check. Mission to save the world, check. Risenborough is superb as the  icy cool, rule following partner, Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an  essentially damsel in distress role, while Morgan Freeman is his usual  solid self in a cameo.   Director Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the  proceedings, and like his previous effort Tron Legacy, gives a solid  bonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum  up, Oblivion may not be terribly original, but it is stylish, well  written and got performances to boot- especially Cruise who is in red  hot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve, but in the immortal words of  Roxette- it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and  enjoy a summer spectacle."
233,Oblivion,9," Excellent Sci Fi movie - do NOT read spoilers!:I SO enjoyed this movie - always LOVE to see a very entertaining sci-fi film. This one really must be seen on a big screen. But don't let anyone tell you about the movie plot (which is excellent)!!! If they start to do so, stick your fingers in your ears and hum! Don't be tempted to read spoilers! Part of your fullest enjoyment of this film would come from everything about it being a surprise. If you like sci-fi, you will thoroughly enjoy the plot line, the action, the actors, wonderful visuals of earth, the music and the well-done special effects. Just watch the trailer if you need to be intrigued. It is a well done representation."
234,Oblivion,8," Solid sci-fi where things aren't what they seem:As this film opens narrator/protagonist Jack Harper explains the situation to us; the film is set some time after a war during which the Earth was attacked by aliens dubbed 'Scavs'; these Scavs destroyed the moon which led to cataclysmic events on Earth and although the Scavs were defeated humanity was forced to relocate to Titan. In order to provide energy for those on Titan the Earth's oceans are used a fuel for giant fusion reactors. Jack is a technician who works, with colleague Victoria, to maintain the drones that protect the reactors from the few remaining Scavs. In order to protect the Earth's secrets they have both had their memories wiped before their five year mission.Despite this memory wipe Jack dreams of a woman who he has apparently not met before and has an interest in pre-war items he finds. Everything changes for Jack when a pre-war spacecraft returns to Earth; the drones eliminate all but one of the survivors the woman of Jack's dreams. He soon learns that nothing was quite what he believed; friends become enemies and enemies become friends as he must decide how to save humanity and the woman he loves.I didn't know much about this film before watching it; just the blurb on the DVD box and the fact that it starred Tom Cruise this is probably the best way to go into the film as there is an enjoyable sense of mystery as we wonder what Jack's dreams mean and start to question the 'facts' he has told us. There are hints that things aren't quite what they seem but nothing definite until the 'big revelation' half way through the film and even then not everything has been revealed. This gradual revealing of the truth kept me gripped. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack and he is ably supported be Andrea Riseborough as Victoria and Olga Kurylenko as the woman in his dreams. Morgan Freeman also puts in a solid performance but his part is much smaller than his second billing would lead one to expect. The special effects are great; I especially liked the aircraft Jack uses and the tower he and Victoria are based in one could almost believe they were real. While this isn't really an action film there are moments of impressive action including a fight between Jack and another technician who looks remarkably familiar. Overall I found this to be a really enjoyable film that fans of sci-fi and Tom Cruise are likely to enjoy."
235,Oblivion,8," GREAT FOR THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN! And maybe everyone!:They don't make many science fiction films these days. This was a pleasant surprise all throughout the film. Man did I like this film.And in my opinion. Tom Cruise really likes what he does, and works at his craft as an actor very seriously. In my opinion 95% of Cruises movies in the last 10 years have been good choices. And I'm sick of what the media says about his personal life.I am one who went and saw Prometheus with an open mind. And listened to what the director said about it NOT being an Aliens movie. And LOVED IT. Good Sci-fi. Such as this film.It definitely turned out to be something I wasn't expecting.Excellent Job by Everyone involved. Nice work Cruise!"
236,Oblivion,9," A beautiful movie you won't regret seeing:Brilliant writing; great performance by the actors; beautiful and realistic scenery; wit that makes us laugh, and a story we passionately follow with a proper ending that make us think about what does matter in life.What more can one want from a movie? 9 out of 10 for what may be one of the best movies ever made in this genre."
237,Oblivion,8," Visually excellent though slightly too long:This movie is - without a doubt - one of the most visually spectacular that I have ever seen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in that department with the likes of Watchmen, Prometheus, Sunshine and Kosinski's preceding effort - TRON: Legacy. Also (like TRON) the soundtrack is excellent and very well used throughout, enhancing the action and adding depth to some - at times - distinctly average acting performances.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that's not a bad thing in this case, in fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he's really not on screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga Kurylenko's statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her character's actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the best performance, convincing as the sad and confused Victoria, unwilling - or perhaps unable - to confront the disturbing truth.At over 2 hours I think that it's too long by about 20 minutes. A shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower sections which I think hurt the movie's overall rhythm and flow.Overall, I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the cinema, on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won't be the same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough, but combined with a clever (if not entirely original) script, a thumping soundtrack and some exciting action, you should be entertained."
238,Oblivion,8," Invasion  Recollections and Truth:In 2077, the human Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works with his companion Victoria ""Vic"" (Andrea Riseborough) on the surveillance station Tech 49. Jack repairs drones and his memory was erased as part of the security process to stay on Earth, and he knows that Earth is completely depleted after sixty years of war against the alien invaders Scavengers ""Scavs"". The aliens have destroyed the moon and were defeated by nuclear weapons and the earthlings have moved to Jupiter's moon Titan since the planet was completely destroyed. Now Jack has to protect the power stations that use the ocean to supply energy to Titan fixing the drones. He also has recollections of a mysterious woman at the Empire State Building when Earth was habitable. Jack and Vic receive instructions from Sally (Melissa Leo), who is located on the space station Tet, and Vic is anxious to leave Earth in two weeks to join the survivors on Titan. However, Jack has a cabin in a secret place where he likes to stay alone. When the spacecraft Odyssey crashes on Earth, Jack witnesses the drones killing the human crew but he rescues a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who is the woman of his recollections. Julia and Jack recover the flight recorder but they are captured by the Scavengers. Soon they learn that the Scavs are actually a group of humans led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) that tells to Jack that the invasion was a lie. Jack does not believe and Malcolm releases Julia and Jack and asks them to go to the radiation zone to find the truth.""Oblivion"" is a great sci-fi movie, with an engaging and entertaining story of alien invasion, recollections from the past and the truth. I am not fan of Tom Cruise, but he has a perfect performance in the role of a man that discovers the truth of the alien invasion. The plot is very well constructed, with intelligent plot points, one of them inspired in ""Lunar"", and the special effects complement the story as should be. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Oblivion"""
239,Oblivion,7," much better than expected !:The trivia tells us that this is based on a comic book that director joseph kosinski wrote in 2005 but was never published. The story takes place in 2077, just after the ""memory wipe"" that jack (cruise) describes for us. And the invasion by space travelers, which destroyed most of the cities and made living on the surface mostly impossible. Some great special effets. The control panels, the copter, even the wrecked surface of the planet. Jack is tasked with protecting the structures that support the floating living quarters for the remaining population. I LOVE the mini moto that jack rides around on... kind of like a george jetson briefcase that folds and unfolds. Google it. Some beautiful scenery of iceland, and various film locs in the united states. When another human from the past crash lands, we're not sure what her mission is, or who's side she is on. Some really good suspense, while we wait for answers. Especially when morgan freeman is involved. Really good sci-fi stuff!"
240,Oblivion,10," A unexpectedly really good movie.:Without revealing any spoilers, I saw this movie ""out of the blue"". Never saw a trailer (I still haven't). I remember hearing the name of the movie and completely forgot about it, and just decided to take a chance and watch it on cable TV one night. It is a Sci-Fi movie with a human heart, so you don't need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it. Also, I am not a Tom Cruise addict, but he does a great job in his usual way. In fact, all the actors portray their characters very well.There is mystery, action, a little bit of love, and some adventure. The beginning is good, there is a high point, and the ending of the movie is satisfactory in my opinion. The special effects are executed in a way not to take away from the story or the plot, and the story does not revolve around them, but rather they are just a part of the story. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, I have to say it is well worth the viewing, not too predictable. Sit back and relax, you'll enjoy this gem."
241,Oblivion,8," I enjoyed it:I recommend Oblivion. The special effects alone make it worth seeing. Unless you choose to watch this film with a chip on your shoulder. Or if you think every homage is merely a rip-off of another film.There are many references to other sci-fi classics, which I found enjoyable. But I did not dwell on them during my viewing, because I was engaged in the story and the visuals.I also liked the cast, though, in some ways, they were playing second fiddle to the visuals. The sound and music were also enjoyable (the Led Zep sequence was magical).This film is best seen on a big screen with theater sound."
242,Oblivion,10," An Orgasmic Audio-Visual Fair!:Here's a fine example of a film that may have an inconsistent and a familiar screenplay, but still makes up for an exciting watch due to its director Joseph Kosinski's extra-ordinary sense of creating spectacles that feel like breathing artworks. The effective background music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic audio-visual fair, just like Kosinski's previous and debut film- Tron:Legacy. He's more ambitious here, and more passionate. Although, you can't help but recognize the influences behind the story-which are some sci-fi epics I won't name here-and feel deja-vu; it still never stops being exciting and interesting. Oh, BTW I suggest to listen to Oblivion OST by M83 (amazing shoegaze/electronica band) before going for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans Zimmer-Daft Punk-M83 all together at once. And that's effing awesome!I wait for the day when Kosinski is handed an ambitious and promising screenplay. That day, I believe, he will make a master-piece worth savoring for lifetime."
243,Oblivion,9," Spoiler-free review  the less you know the better you'll enjoy it:I really wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw the movie trailer a long time ago. I came up with all sorts of fun endings in my own mind based on the trailer and eventually my curiosity caused me to read too much and I read some spoilers that I wish I hadn't. I still enjoyed the film immensely, but wish I hadn't read the spoilers and suggest you shy away from all potential spoilers, reading as little as possible before seeing the movie. So when you're done with this review, don't read anymore, just go see the movie.I had the good fortune of watching this movie at an advance screening on a smaller IMAX screen and I really enjoyed it, as did the huge audience, judging by the lively and jovial banter as people exited. The movie follows Jack Harper who is a drone repair tech in a future earth that has been ravaged by an alien invasion. He has a by-the-books eye-in-the-sky (literally) assistant named Victoria (nicknamed Vika) who watches out for Jack and reports to Central. They live together in a sky platform to avoid the alien scavs who come out at night. Jack is keeping the drones repaired to defend huge energy machines from being attacked by the scavs. Once enough energy has been stored up from the world's oceans by the energy machines, the remaining survivors of earth hope to leave in a few short weeks for the safety of a new base on Saturn's Titan. To protect certain things, Jack and Victoria's memories have been erased before their present situation. Jack is confused about why they have to leave earth, whereas Vika is ready to go, but they both cherish and respect each other. Then Jack meets Malcolm Beech who tells Jack that things are not exactly how they seem, which sets off a series of events that eventually lead to the end of the movie.Some critics have mentioned something like ""we've seen these ideas before"" in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se, that doesn't make the movie less appealing, IMO. Thinking back to when I was much younger and saw the trailer for the movie Independence Day in the theatre, I remember thinking that the movie looked really fun despite the fact that there've been a zillion alien invasion movies before, but I still hoped they'd do a great job with it because the trailer for the movie was awesome. Was there anything earth-shatteringly new about the movie? Not really, but it was still excellent entertainment. That's how I feel about Oblivion. To me, it's great entertainment.The only minor complaints I had was that the volume of the music while Jack and Vika were in the pool was too much and sometimes things dragged ever so slightly between action sequences. Overall though, this movie was definitely a remarkable treat."

245,Oblivion,10," A Nutshell Review: Oblivion:Written by Joseph Kosinski, KArl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt, and directed by the Kasinski, who was also responsible for bringing a new spin to the Tron legacy, Kasinski traded the dark settings of that film for the light and bright, minimalist and futuristic look at Earth some 60 years after 2017, where unknown alien forces had taken out Earth's moon, and plunging the planet into chaos with its unpredictable forces of mother nature ravaging it, followed by an invasion that took out most of the human population. The war was won, but at the expense of the planet since the nuclear fallout made it uninhabitable. So the survivors made that interplanetary migration to Saturn's moon Titan, leaving behind a skeletal crew of two - Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) - some drones, and a forward base controller (Melissa Leo) to harness energy from the oceans. And of course to mop up what's left of the alien race still down on earth.However, that's what we're lulled to believe, as we follow the typical day of Jack and Victoria, who wake up, get to work, with Jack essentially being a human Wall.E, repairing broken down drones, and patrolling their assigned territory from the skies. Jack and Victoria enjoy life as per any typical couple with not much for recreation at night, but there's something niggling in Jack's mind, being haunted by memories of a strange, beautiful female (Olga Kurylenko), something that shouldn't happen given their mind wipe, and whose unannounced, surprising presence threatens to upset their entire couple harmony, and their effectiveness as a team. Three's a crowd and making things worse is when jealousy enters the picture.To say any more would be to ruin the many surprises in store, which lead to the many revelations that when pieced together will make perfect sense, since the writers kept the cards close to their chests, revealing crucial plot points at intervals, which is frustrating yet satisfying, and well worth the wait, although sometimes at the expense of pace, or editing continuity that wasn't as smooth as it would have liked to be. But no matter. Granted that the expositions won't be anything new, with genre clichés abound that the fans amongst us would be able to predict, but it's how these elements come together so perfect that makes Oblivion such a worthwhile watch. Yes there are the sleekly designed vehicles befitting a sci-fi flick here, with the necessary attention to detail and explanation to make everything seem plausible for this apocalyptic vision of the future.But I love the emotional core that anchored the film a hell lot more, so much so that I dare say not a lot of films, and a science fiction one at that, managed to move. It deals with the longing of a normal life, which Jack had desired as he slips off the radar now and then to build that illusion of an idyllic life in a pocket of paradise he found, with reason of course to come later in the narrative. And the love triangle was well played out, where its beginnings couldn't come any simpler than a brush, a touch and a photograph, all very fleeting, to sucker punch it through to your heart. And just how all these humanity blends so well with the CG- ed technology on display, that made it unbelievably solid.Tom Cruise is a very different animal here altogether, without his usual toothy grin, and being a lot more serious, sombre and contemplative with his character, that worked wonders. No doubt the obvious hero in the film, many elements of heroism got played down to make it a simple fight for the survival of a loved one, without grandeur plans of needing to save the day at the forefront. Olga Kurylenko may be the flower vase here, but what an effective one playing opposite Cruise for the first time, with her sheer presence making it believable the extent a man would go out for her. Andrea Riseborough, being the relative rookie amongst the three, also stood her own, playing what would be a tragic character seeing her blissful future snatched from under her feet. Her subtleness in her final scene in the film, spoke volumes of her ability to say so much with so little.A couple of scenes that stood out for me, such as the black and white flashback scene involving Jack and Julia (Kurylenko) when they meet before going up the Empire State Building, communications between Victoria and Jack when their perfect teaming started to give way, together with just above every revelation that had Jack flabbergasted, and those sweeping cinematography of landscapes of a broken Earth. And what provided this film that extra dimension, is the excellent and hauntingly beautiful score by M83 that lifts this film into another emotional stratosphere altogether, that without which, the movie isn't likely going to be as memorable, or emotional, as it got made out to be.Watch Oblivion on the IMAX screen no less, for those awesome visuals to envelope right up to the peripherals of your vision, and for that crystal clear pounding of the soundscapes and soundtrack right into your aural senses. This is the modern day treatment of The Wachowski's The Matrix in a certain way without the philosophical babble, but my, I'd give it five stars and a perfect ten! A definite recommendation, and a firm entry into my shortlist as one of the best films this year so far!"
246,Oblivion,," Battlefield Earth is feeling less lonely:The only good news here is that sometimes a movie can do everything so wrong it becomes as revealing about what works in a film as one by a master.In just the awful expositional slab of voice-over monologue, we find out that aliens exist and have destroyed the moon, the Earth is an uninhabited wasteland, humanity lives in Saturn, and our protagonist has had his memory wiped off. This is just indicative of the overall mess that follows. The film is a hodge podge of seemingly every sci-fi movie made in the past 50 years. Individual moments recall everything from Dune to Riddick to The Matrix to 2001, but the main effect is closer to Battlefield Earth.Overall the effect it has on me is like watching a kid create a story and world around his toys. He looks immersed setting up who did what, but it's all a framework for bumping noises. I'm illustrating this in three areas, though the film is bad from start to finish.In the connecting logic: an enterprise with an estimable cost in the trillions is operated by two people on the ground, so far as they know anyway. One of them flies around repairing things, by himself. During a crisis, with a hydrogen plant in flames after sabotage and one of the drones missing, he takes off to relax in a cabin in the woods. Basically everything about the mission makes as much sense as Planet of the Vampires. Later some of this is reconstituted by an even dumber twist.In the emotional gravity: our hero's love of his life is shot at one point and dying. How is this dealt in the film? Simple, Cruise flies off to another station, sneaks in, picks up medicine and flies out to her again in time to save her, in essence reversing fate. The gravest action is rolled back without consequence, removing any weight of subsequent grave happenings.In the cinematic gravity: in good action films, when things crash or explode we feel this by having the camera tethered to the forces. Watch the scene where Cruise is chased by the drones-the motion and impacts are poor, the situating of our eye is as dopey as rear-projection in its time. The environments are mediocre throughout. This is the biggest failure, because even the dumbest action film can excite if we are placed the right way.Something else.A movie steeped in technology recasts technology, in the gnostic trope usual in sci-fi, as the crazed demigod in the sky sucking up the planet's energy, imprisoning the self. Peace is equated with nature and playing old records, after one has sacrificed himself in the 'temple of his gods', dying what in Walt Whitman's time was called a 'good death'. Since then, the concept has gone from Yankee Protestantism to Salafi Jihadism, you'd think bringing into crisper focus the absurdity of it, but no.Just mentioning these as more indications of the short-sightedness here."
247,Oblivion,4," Great CGI  good actors  terrible story.:This post-apocalyptic science fiction movie tackles the story of a man who has been posted in the uninhabited Earth to repair the machines that exploit Earth's resources, after the planet is destroyed in a galactic war between humans and aliens. The script seems interesting at first glance, but we soon lost interest in the film because the story does not have much else to explore. Tom Cruise plays the main character and does it in a very correct way, but his character is overwhelmingly boring and the story is very monotonous. Morgan Freeman is another actor who excels in this film, leading a good cast that has received a bad material to work because of the poor script, with good ideas but poorly developed. The big bet of this movie is CGI, with great plans of our planet destroyed, especially New York. Visually, the movie is great, with optimal cinematography and superior quality sound effects. But that is not enough to make a good movie, not even when Tom Cruise is added to the recipe."
248,Oblivion,8," A Fantastic and Note-worthy Experience of Good SF:In the world of science fiction, there have been many stories that have been adapted to the point where we've just grown tired of the same old stuff, but sometimes, someone comes along and re-creates that story with great vision and excellence. Oblivion is one of these movies, offering different and unique plot points, fantastic acting, phenomenal visuals and directing that is pitch-perfect. Following an alien invasion, 60 years have passed, and Earth is now a wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a member of team 49, goes around repairing drones, which canvas the planet and eliminate the aliens still there. But when Jack is captured by a human resistance leader on Earth (Morgan Freeman), he is told that everything he knows is a lie, and that something is very, very wrong. He sides with these mysterious rebels, and begins to fight for not just love, but for his home.Joseph Kosinski, the director and co-writer, as well as writer of the graphic novel the film is based on, creates a truly fantastically frightening world with Oblivion. His direction in many scenes is so smooth and crisp that you forget, this is only is second film. The acting is superb, with Tom Cruise being at the height of his game after doing the well-made thriller Jack Reacher, based off of Lee Child's novel. I can understand why people were upset with Morgan Freeman's short screen time, but at least he was in it. I still came to love his character because he was an important one; he made Jack see reality. Olga Kurylenko was great in her role as the mysterious woman who knows Jack from his past. The visual effects, once again, were stunning, with the post-apocalyptic Earth being truly remarkable and extremely detailed. But the aliens were a true treat in the film, being very unique and different. Now, while I see many people trying to find ways of lowering the rating for the film, like movie connections, I can say, the connections are incredibly vague and little. Those who claim this is too close to ""The Matrix"", it's not. Humans were enslaved, and used as batteries by machines. In Oblivion, we are nearly extinct, and aliens have come and gone. Jack Harper is a curious individual, while Neo was content with ""his"" reality. Malcolm Beech was a leader, but had limits, while Morpheus had zero. I could keep going, but that just takes away from the review. The music by M83 was just spectacular; a must-listen and own for anyone who appreciates musical soundtracks and scores.Overall, Oblivion is a great addition to a constantly growing sci-fi universe that has had great additions in the past five years alone, and more to come. This is not a film for everyone, being a straight-up science fiction film, but for anyone who loves action, sci-fi or good filmmaking. Now, I do see a few award-worthy things about Oblivion, including Tom Cruise's acting, M83's musical score and the visual effects, but mainly this is just one to be seen and acknowledged for its greatness for expanding the genre, and adding a fresh and creative vision to the mix, but not a contender for Best Picture, sadly, falling just short of that, but still a better film of the year.9/10 Stars***"
249,Oblivion,6," Among The Gorgeous Exteriors:Oblivion feels like a homage to the old science fiction films where it explores around its world, shows off its landscapes, soar all the ships that used to be made out of cardboard, and let the characters scrutinize until the plot finds the actual conflict. The film features plenty of amazing concepts and spectacular visuals that could be intriguing. There seems to be a theme at the first half but all the questionable twists made the plot convoluted. It's disappointing when it hits to that point. It still can be entertaining and the technical work is indeed a splendor. There's plenty of potential around but there is still something missing in the end.The film reminiscence a lot of popular sci-fi films. It has the exteriors of Planet of the Apes and a plot that runs and remind you of Alien, Total Recall, and I Am Legend(I don't want to spoil the next film that resembles). The first act is totally gripping by introducing its high concept. When it proceeds to the actual story, there is suppose to be even more mindblowing than it was shown. It throws away some intriguing twists, but the film doesn't bother explaining enough what's the point about it. There's also an interesting pathos of Jack missing the old less-broken world at the beginning, but the story easily ignores it. Many would think it doesn't matter, but that might possibly bring some soul to the picture. It's centrally about finding the protagonist's identity. The romance is ought to be important for his journey but this relationship wasn't develop much, leading as a typical love subplot. The performances are just typical for the actors. Tom Cruise plays his usual hero roles. It's fine for the film's character though. Morgan Freeman once again serving up details of the plot. The only thing what's different is he wears a costume that looks pretty good to him.Despite of the underwhelming storytelling, we still get to see some rich futuristic details. The film has its own style and creates a marvelous world. Other than the whimsically designed rubble of the destroyed earth, all the weapons, ships, and costumes are quite snazzy to appeal for those who seek for eye catching stuff. If there's one thing Joseph Kosinski has improved then that would be the suspense. Tron: Legacy actually had none of them, this one knows the aesthetics of a sci-fi horror thriller. Those thrills are just limited, though. He's still in his comfort zone by only caring for the pretty visuals and the techno soundtrack.Oblivion is almost better than it was expected. It would have been as good as it looks like if only it was eager to put more explanation about the intrigue, and soul to the story. It leaves the audience thought provoked. The bright side is it's not one of those generically loud modern sci-fi films. It's one of those basic, yet classic style of science fiction. It's a great thing especially for this era of blockbusters. Everything in the film looks stunning and breathtaking. It's terribly entertaining as well if we don't mind those flaws. Again, the film offered something remarkable but fails to execute because of its pretension. We get it, the visuals and the soundtrack are the best part of the film, but I think it deserves better than those. Honestly, Oblivion can be a classic if it adds something smarter and much meaningful. For now, all the beautiful landscapes that were featured will be the only thing that would spellbind the audience throughout."
250,Spider-Man: No Way Home,," Loved every second:This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!"
251,Spider-Man: No Way Home,6," Great concept  mediocre execution:A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how naïve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick."
252,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," Phenomenal conclusion:Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic."
253,Spider-Man: No Way Home,5," I consider myself to be a big fan of Marvel and definitely of Spider-Man  but something wasn't right about this film:Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be ""cured""(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like ""yeah this guy sucks"" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason."
254,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," Somehow better than Endgame:It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write."
255,Spider-Man: No Way Home,4," Nonsense And Nostalgia:Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great."
256,Spider-Man: No Way Home,9, Just Awesome !:It was very enjoyable to watch in the cinema. The expected theories turned out to be true. Acting was great. The script was pretty good. I will watch it for the second time) It was the best Spiderman movie in my opinion. It's also one of the best Marvel movies. Be sure to watch it in the cinema!
257,Spider-Man: No Way Home,6," Definitely one for the fans...:Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
258,Spider-Man: No Way Home,9," SUPERHERO EXTRAVAGANZA!!!:Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!"
259,Spider-Man: No Way Home,6," A franchise in decline  and this meta nonsense doesn't help:I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies."
260,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," A MASSIVE treat for every Spidey fan out there.:This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself."
261,Spider-Man: No Way Home,3," A Movie For Children:It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says ""I'm something of a scientist myself."" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)"
262,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2," Dull  Bland And Dumb:It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary."
263,Spider-Man: No Way Home,5," Idiotic childish movie:I really do NOT understand the high score for this movie.The storyline is idiotic and childish with monsters and spider-men coming from different dimensions all because some spell from dr. Strange went bad.My God, what a piece of crap this movie...
The special effects are as expected great but the rest is really a bunch of nonsense!I love Spider-man, Batman, the Hulk etc but this movie is really terrible and I wasted 148minutes precious time.Take my word for it: the best thing to do is to skip this movie and wait for something better to watch, which is not hard as there are not many movies as dumb as this one!"
264,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," Wow!:What cinemas were made for. I wasn't expecting something quite as amazing as this, this was two and a half hours of incredible entertainment, drama, laughs, tears and action galore, there truly was something for everyone here.This movie really has ignited my love for the franchise once again, and I am truly excited for what comes next.Nostalgia, there seems to be a real thirst for it these days, and there is a lot of it to enjoy here. There are plenty of moments throughout that will have you speechless, they really do break all of the rules here.This is one incredibly good looking movie, dazzling special effects, dizzying action scenes, two and a half hours will literally fly by.Incredible, 10/10."
265,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," Homeless and restless:There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ..."
266,Spider-Man: No Way Home,4," A lazy mash up of Spider-Man films:I was disappointed, they have run out of ideas so they bring out Spider-Man greatest hits. I found it rather boring and I think it's getting silly all these cross over films but the masses keep going so they will continue to make them. It's a good film for die hard fans but for the casual viewer it lacks any real substance."
267,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!:Peter is back! Everyone knows who he is and that's the problem! This is a fantastic spiderman movie, no.. this is the ultimate Spiderman movie. This was such an experience i honestly felt like a kid again. I can't believe they returned! I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend! A Must See!!! 11/10."
268,Spider-Man: No Way Home,8," They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing!:They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time."
269,Spider-Man: No Way Home,9," CRAZY:Don't watch the trailers. Just watch the movie. I'm not going to say much. It's amazing. And I'm in complete disbelief that it actually happened. Well-made, well-acted, well-directed. Fun, funny and crazy with a ton of heart. Can't wait to watch it again. (5 viewings, opening night IMAX 12/16/2021, IMAX 12/29/2021, IMAX 1/20/2022, IMAX 2/2/2022, Re-issue UltraScreen 9/7/2022)"
270,Spider-Man: No Way Home,1," Dumbed down to new lows.:The marvel films have been turned to dumbed down comic moronic trash. It seems that only those who can leave their brains behind are supposed to watch this kindergarten stuff. What a fall in quality, intensity and direction from Sam Raimi's days. He started the franchise on a high note. Now, the trash is unrecognizable. However, its understandable, as the world is increasingly getting dumber. The films are being dumbed down to keep up with the changing times."
271,Spider-Man: No Way Home,1, Ridiculousness:I'm unsure of why this has received a high IMDb rating. It's rubbish and slow and nonsensical. Instead this film rakes in all past cast members for some obscure reminiscent feelgood film. Trash at its Hollywood best. You've been warned.
272,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10," Best Movie Of The Year:First of all, i was so grateful to be experience this movie in theaters, with a great audience that as excited as me, they were clapping and the movie deserve it, Spider-Man No Way Home is everybody's dream, it's an exciting movie, with an epic story, and phenomenal performance, it just amazing, it's incredible, it's fantastic, it's mind blowing, it's an experience that i will never forget, once cross in my mind that this one is probably even better than Avengers Endgame, but as the time goes, it's still not reach that level but that really doesn't mean anything, both movie are epic, Spider-Man No Way Home is one of the greatest movie i've ever watch, one of the greatest superhero movie i've ever watch, and it simply The Best Movie Of The Year."
273,Spider-Man: No Way Home,7," Spectacle  But Not Spectacular:My expectations for this film were off the chart due to what I had heard and read about how great it is. What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends."
274,Spider-Man: No Way Home,6," Very cool idea; extremely poor plot:Such a a cool concept and bringing back the other 2 Spider-Man is all we fans wanted / but the story, plot, character motivations and script was not up to the challenge.Biggest flaw is that Spider-Man chose to 'save' these villains (putting everyone's lives at risk) for what reason? Because he's so good inside? There are infinite villains and Spider-Man so this motivation is weak and frustratingly illogical.Plus they stuff up a magic spell and no one thinks to go find Wanda? Theyve clearly outlined she's more powerful than the sorceress supreme. No? No one?Not go to Wakanda? Nothing?Killing May is just the same 'fridging that all the lame old superhero movies use to isolate the hero. It's dull as dishwater and now they've wiped away all the coolness of this interaction for out of date adages.And the moping... Jesus Christ that's dull. All the navel gazing 'what's it all about', 'who am I'. Massive yawn. This movie was at least 20 mins too long.The big reveal of Toby and Andrew? What a letdown. Wouid have been better in an action scene where Spider-Man is about to smashed and a web comes out of nowhere... much cooler.And lastly the memory wipe. So no one remembers him? What about school records? How does Happy know he knows May 'through Spider-Man'? Who does he think that is then?This movie is a 7 and anyone giving it any more is just excited because of the fan theory hype and not."
275,Crimes of the Future,," Dark horror sci-fi in Cronenberg's usually entertaining take on the dynamic of humanity and technology.:""Surgery is the new sex."" Caprice (Lea Seydoux)Although I have a less sensual feeling about surgery than Caprice, David Cronenberg in his new Crimes of the Future makes the case for the tyranny of cosmetic and internal organ rehab for the human body. ""Body horror"" is the name of his game. He is so good at observing the close relationship between technology and the body that this horror cum philosophy disturber gets attention and doesn't let go. And sometimes it makes sense.At a science fiction future time, humans are growing synthetic organs and messing around with plastic surgery so that the parallel with the contemporary urge for surgery is unavoidable. The blight of plastic in our environment is brought home when a boy chomps on a plastic basket.The main performance artist, Saul (Vigo Mortenson), has become a rock star of synthetic organs reminiscent of Kafka's troubled Hunger Artist. Garbed sometimes like Death in Bergman's Seventh Seal, Saul publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in performances catering to a jaded humanity.As his assistant and surgeon, Caprice operates on and models his new organs resulting from his ""designer cancer."" As for the two actually having old-fashioned sex, I'm not so sure but am wary of the future population decline, as the Chinese have experienced.Another female who works for the director's symbolic machine is Timlin (Kristen Stewart), under the employ of The National Organ Registry (ominous title with malevolent bureaucratic properties) and desirous of connecting with Saul's celebrity. Like other citizens, she is seeking sensation as a byproduct of pain deficiency and dull affect. When she unzips his stomach zipper and licks his wounds, echoes of the old oral sex intrude.Enough said of the organ motif, for more organic to Crimes of the Future is the human evolution to dangerous surgery and questionable cosmetics, a world almost devoid of humanity and full of narcissism. While it is a world devoid of pain, it's the interior emotions that seem, like the synthetic organs, vulnerable. The ""inner beauty pageant"" is the one salutary oddity contrasted with the ugly organ expos.Crimes of the Future is easier to stomach, so to speak, than would be suspected. There's almost a Zen acceptance of the evolution that stands somewhere between The Fly and Crash, highly symbolic and slightly hopeful about humanity's survival, but accepting that crimes are always in our future."
276,Crimes of the Future,5," The synopsis:Mortensen plays a grunting Sith Lord with acid reflux who's constantly playing with himself. Then they talk about organs or something and sex but there's never any sex and then Kristen Stewart appears a few times as a nervous crying lady who's turned on by Mortensen. And then there's subplots about child murder, poisonous candy bars, a dinosaur bone high chair that feeds you crappy raviolis, and a whole lot of other whacky stuff. Also Lea Seydoux is there and she helps cut Mortensen up. I really didn't understand it but I sure had fun explaining it.C?"
277,Crimes of the Future,4," Interestingly weird but extremely dull:This movie starts out great, with an awesomely dark opening scene to set the mood. It's really weird immediately and reaches high levels of grossness, but I surprisingly dug it. In many movies set in the future, it really isn't much different except for the technology and a few aesthetics. But here, we see a really interesting depiction of where humanity ends up, some of which I find scarily possible.Unfortunately, it's extremely dull with just the slightest hint of a story and doesn't amount to anything. By the end I was checked out, or else I might've been furious at how it ends. I think many people will think this is one of the worst movies they've seen. (1 viewing, 6/8/2022)"
278,Crimes of the Future,8," The entire movie feels like it is building up to a worthwhile and tremendous climax that the film never hits; but conceptually  this is brilliant:Crimes of the Future (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a future where surgery and pain is the new sex. In the future they don't feel pain so they push the limits of the human body. They've gone so far in their experiments the human body has begun to evolve in new ways science has never seen and the government wishes to hide from society. Underground observations has become the rage to whiteness surgeries that explore the human body and its evolution.This movie is directed by David Cronenberg (Dead Ringers) and stars Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), Kristen Stewart (Twilight), Léa Seydoux (Spectre), Scott Speedman (Underworld) and Welket Bungué (Upheavel).The storyline, settings l, cinematography and circumstances of this picture are wildly original, unique and well done. The special effects are first rate with fantastic surgery scenes and gore. The characters are mysterious and unpredictable and there are tremendous plots and subplots in this film. My only complaint is the entire movie feels like it is building up to a worthwhile and tremendous climax that the film never hits; but conceptually, this is brilliant.Overall this is a movie that fails to reach its full potential but is wildly entertaining and an absolutely must see. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
279,Crimes of the Future,7," Surgery is the new sex. The depreciation of the natural.:""crimes of the future"" is an efficient film, it does a lot with little, without big sets and gigantic practical effects, everything is very simple but very convincing, the scenery compositions are dirty with a dark photograph, always looking for an intrinsic degradation, the effects practical are good, the few CGI are weak, but the sound editing is magnificent, always looking for sounds that seek the viewer's discomfort, another positive point is the performances, the duo Vigo mortise and Léa Seydoux are very good, Viggo manages to show all the pain and anguish of her character with her body and vocal posture, Kristen is another highlight, making an anxious and paranoid character the actress delivers a very good performance, despite her little screen time, but the best point here, I bring the classic and brilliant Canadian director, david cronenberg, is his script, which, despite being a little confusing, has as its main premise the limit of art, its contradictions and subversive appreciations, its criminal lity, and with that it makes a self-reflection of its own filmography, the film is also a critique of state bureaucracy and government intervention in art, all on a derogatory dystopian futuristic science fiction plan. The feature has some problems, the biggest one is perhaps the subtexts that are open and not always completed. We don't have the best version of Cronenberg here, but his style remains authorial and inviting. Grade 7/10."
280,Crimes of the Future,5," Nice idea barely explored.:Some people in the future muck about with their saucy organs and that's about it. Some of the effects and prosthetics are creative, but some of them are bobbins.The drama is mundane. There's no suspense, tension or stakes. If all the movie had is a premise, then the body horror needed to be bonkers to give the audience a bit of fun. But it's all too serious. The philosophical aspect is brought to the fore, which is the least interesting thing about it. I like that it's trying something different, but it comes at the cost of good storytelling. A simple thriller element would have balanced the movie nicely. Unfortunately, the plot is too thin to hold any weight.The sets and cinematography are good. The acting is clunky and the dialogue is waffling, when it's audible. Cronenberg has fallen victim to the trend of dialogue being whispered, mumbled, fried or delivered in an accent so outrageous that it's hard to decipher what anybody's banging on about.A meandering, middle-of-the-road sci-fi."
281,Crimes of the Future,9," Thought-provoking and original sci-fi with fresh ideas that you have to go along with 100%; a true work of art.:Crimes of the Future is an original and thought-provoking sci-fi arthouse film, featuring great performances from Léa Seydoux, Viggo Mortensen and Kristen Stewart.David Cronenberg approaches his material like that of a final year thesis paper, using his characters as a mouthpiece to discuss the next step of human evolution through biology melding with technology.In the future, climate change and pollution have fast-tracked the advancement in biotechnology. Pain and infectious disease have been eliminated for most of the human race, resulting in human evolution going outside of the natural order.Saul Tenser and Caprice, a performance artist couple who do live avant-garde performances of open surgery, making use of Saul's unique condition of regrowing organs and cutting them off in front of a live audience. For their upcoming show, Saul and Caprice are entangled between an underground organization and government forces about unveiling a key secret about the next phase of human evolution to the public.Jerry Seinfeld once had a joke about how men are fascinated by whatever body parts a woman covers up. If women all started wearing hats one day, men would get their ya-yas from looking at the top of ladies' heads.David Cronenberg applies this very same concept to his own body horror aesthetic in Crimes of the Future. In a world where pain doesn't exist, where would human sexuality go? What would people do to their own bodies for pleasure?The film pushes its sci-fi themes even further to new places and asks, if biotechnology allows us to control our own evolution, should people be allowed to dictate their own evolution? Or should we stay on nature's course?Although it was a challenging watch, I found Crimes of the Future intellectually engaging. It is a pure ideas film and not a film to relate to emotionally. At times, Cronenberg's transhumanism ideas could just as easily be presented as art pieces in a museum exhibit or a novel.There's a lot of time spent in the body horror moments lingering on grotesque wounds, but it is towards a thematic point. Cronenberg isn't holding onto the shot to disgust or scare the audience; he's studying it. He presents the body horror as a reflection of our own humanity, as in, ""If the world was like this, this is what we would probably do to ourselves.""Cronenberg's future world, perhaps due to budget constraints, is all world-built through dialogue, which has a style and rhythm of its own that one must tune their ears to. It was mentally challenging keeping up with what was happening but ultimately rewarding. Watching it with subtitles on will help.The cast does a great job delivering the stylistic dialogue and working together to create an emotional core for what otherwise is a cold cerebral film.Viggo Mortensen is great in a subdued part but it is Léa Seydoux who steals the show. Seydoux dug deep and convinced us that performing live open surgery is as important as Michaelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.Kristin Stewart brought something we've never seen before as a squirrelly horny government clerk, which was funny because I almost wished she performed the Twilight films this way.For the uninitiated, Crimes of the Future could be frustrating at times for its unconventional style and it will play best to David Cronenberg fans or body horror fans who are familiar with his work and will find these ideas fascinating.The film stayed with me long afterwards and the more I thought about it, it slowly blew my mind with its rich ideas. This is a true work of art.I don't know who to recommend this film to without getting vicious complaints afterwards. I suppose the people who want to see Crimes of the Future will see it. Meanwhile, I desperately need to discuss it with someone."
282,Crimes of the Future,3," Rotten to the Core...:An extremely dystopian look at the future, full of scalpels, tattooed growths but not enough suture, the metaphors perish, no personas to cherish, synthetic, superficial, fascicle culture.And it's also extremely dull, while the choking noises will annoy you all the way through."
283,Crimes of the Future,5, Hard to Watch and You Wonder Why You Did:This flick is off the wall even for Cronenberg. And I'm amazed that such well known actors made this dark and almost plotless film.It opens withan outrage and ends with a whimper. The dialogue is vague and depressing as is the premise that future art will be of pain and suffering.
284,Crimes of the Future,2," What Was the Point Exactly?:And I don't want to go to YT and watch a 20-minute video explaining to me the ""deep"" and philosophical themes and ideas of this movie. If a movie can't even in the tiniest way tell me itself what it's actually about, then something is wrong and I don't consider that a good movie. And I'm not talking about movies with actual mindbending plots that you have to watch or read an explanation to get the ending and the story, I'm talking about the movie that doesn't even try to hint at what it actually wants to say. So if I didn't enjoy the story, if I didn't enjoy the way the movie is shot, and if I didn't even enjoy the acting of everyone in this world who act like complete weirdos, and if I didn't like the weird and confusing dialogue, and I only kinda liked the music and some of the body horror stuff, I can't really give it a high or even a mediocre rating.First of all, the movie doesn't even try to present the plot or the characters in an interesting way. Like the director doesn't even care, which there might be something admirable there, but it doesn't make for a good movie. Like do you remember the movie Passengers from 2016, which had an interesting plot but it was mediocre at best, then someone edited the movie and replaced the order of acts 1 and 2 and it became a whole new movie with mystery, suspense, and tension and it made it so much better? Yeah, this movie feels like that but a hundred times worse.Presentation really matters. Things just happen in the movie without a single ounce of suspense or tension. We don't know the characters and we don't really get to know their actual motivation and what they're thinking about. There's even a scene like 10 minutes into the movie that reveals something about the protagonist, but it's presented in the blandest and most unsurprising way. Like it's technically a twist, but it doesn't feel like a twist at all. It's like ""oh, so this happened, cool I guess"". Like they could've shown that in the beginning and it would've made no difference at all.I don't really know why, but apparently, everyone in the future is super creepy and absolute weirdos. Everyone acts weird like they're not even human, but the weirdest one is the Kristen Stewart. Why does she talk like that? Who knows! Why is she always on the verge of crying? Why does she talk and act like someone had her balls in their hand and was squeezing them and she wants to cry and can't speak loud enough all the time?Why is the dialogue so weird, confusing, and meaningless? Why does Viggo Mortensen go around in a ninja suit like he's a vampire or something? ""I get cold"", ok that's cool, but why is that?Why is everyone obsessed with the organs and autopsy? ""Surgery is the new sex"". Really? Did humans develop a new desire related to maiming that is better than sex and orgasm? How? The movie doesn't even tell us if or how or why they are enjoying it more than sex. They say at the beginning that humans no longer feel pain and infections are gone, so no matter what you do with your body, you won't get a disease or feel any pain at all. But how does that lead to enjoying getting cut and having your internal organs pulled out feel better than sex? Why is everything shown from the life of these people, is just eating weird mushy food and talking about bodies and organs every second of their life? Like are they so obsessed that they have literally nothing else to do?The budget is really small, so I get that we're not gonna get Blade Runner 2049 level of world-building and set pieces. But the whole movie is literally in ruins and ship graveyards. I'm not kidding, literally every ""house"", every ""art gallery"", and that office is an abandoned house with rundown walls.I really don't know what the point of the ""twist"" was, if it wasn't gonna go anywhere. Or the point of those two women, if they don't show, tell, or even hint at who they were and why they did what they did. It just seems like a movie with a couple of ideas that go absolutely nowhere at all.The only movie from Cronenberg I've seen, a while back, was eXistenZ, and I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed the twists, I enjoyed the mystery, the suspense, and all the gross body horror stuff, and I was really shocked how well it predicted what video games in the future are gonna look like. Like you could say it was Matrix before Matrix. So I thought Cronenberg was pretty smart and he predicted video games really well in a genius way. But this is nothing like that, the concept is weird and it's presented in the blandest way as if the director didn't care at all, it's not clear what it wants to say or what it is actually about, and it's not a fun watch like eXistenZ.But then again, eXistenZ shockingly did really predict how video games were going to be very well, so who knows, maybe we'll look back at this movie in 30 years and we'll be awestruck with how accurate this movie was!"
285,Crimes of the Future,2," Cronenberg has lost his touch in this absolute bore of a film:Well, that was a complete waste of my time. Talk about a movie that is equally as weird as it is boring. There is so much going on, yet nothing is happening at the same time, and not a single bit of it is explained well enough to grasp. David Cronenberg has officially lost his touch as a filmmaker. Not to mention this one might win an award for the worst cinematography ever put to screen. A vast majority of the scenes were so dark that I couldn't see what was on screen and I felt like I was just staring at silhouettes of characters talking. Combine that with some really terrible cgi and you've got a recipe for the ugliest movie ever made. The only strong aspect the film has going for it is the acting. You can tell the actors really gave it their all with the material they were given. Overall, the film felt like a complete waste, and a half baked effort on behalf of the director. There is definitely a reason as to why I was the only one in the theater for this one. Also, for the preview to make this film out to be so disturbing, I can assure you it is not. Hell, it's even very light on the blood and gore, which the preview built up as well. Majorly disappointed in that category. I can recommend this film for people who want to take a nap, it will definitely put you to sleep. 1 fleshy instrument out of 5."
286,Crimes of the Future,6," The future of art....:65/100My expectations for the film were completely off. The trailer made me think that the film was going to be one way, but turned out it was the opposite.While it wasn't as I expected it was still a decent film. It was artistic, dark, twisted, and intriguing. The story had an interesting concept. ""Surgery is the new sex"". With that in my mind now it really opens a new visual to the film.The performance was very well done. It's been awhile since I've seen Viggo Mortensen in a film. He was excellent and I enjoyed his performance. Having only seen Léa Seydoux in ""James Bond"" previously, I thought she did an excellent job as well opposite Viggo. Continuing with the acting performances, this is perhaps the first film that I enjoyed Kristen Stewart's performance. Just her shyness and dark persona made her likeable.The film does lose a lot interest because it becomes too slow at times and drags on more than it needs to a certain moments. While a slower pace is key to the film it's just too slow.Overall, there is some good intriguing moments to the film that I struggle to convey into words. A twisted art story involving slicing and dicing the body. Honestly, it was worth seeing in theatres, but I would've preferred to see it on a cheap night.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you a little in making a decision. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
287,Crimes of the Future,1," Conflicted:Overall confusing because it has a lot of futuristic terms that is pretty vague and hard to understand. The pacing was slow and character interactions were all weird and bland. The story was nonsensical, I couldn't connect or engage with it. I didn't liked most of the performances because of the soulless dialogue delivery. It seems some cast members picked randomly without an audition."
288,Crimes of the Future,1," Awful:I'm not sure if anyone watched the same movie as I did, but this movie was awful from start to finish. Slow boring and stupid plot. I would never recommend it or see it again."
289,Crimes of the Future,8," A surprisingly pleasant return to form from Cronenberg!:A lot of people are passionately disliking this film and I'm not really sure what they were expecting. Have they forgotten what classic Cronenberg films are actually like? Have they lost the plot in their own skewed fantasy of a David Cronenberg film that's been distorted over years of non-exposure while his ever-emboldening reputation only feeds each delusional individual's twisted perception of his filmography?Cronenberg's fleshy visuals have always been singular, striking, and disturbing - but they've typically been an added bonus to what really makes his films legendary, and that's CONCEPT. Concept is far and away the strength and the entire point of Crimes Of The Future - the primary plot, the philosophies it presents, and all the ideas that branch out around it. Nearly every scene introduces an intriguing idea or philosophy that takes the concept one step further, and as a viewer, if you are able to keep up with it, the extremely forward-thinking ideas generally become more fathomable with every conversation. It's amusing to me that ""The Future"" is right there in the title, and still it seems that the primary problem people are having is that they cannot look ahead far enough to perceive these ideas as even remotely realistic or relatable in any manner. Well, people felt the same way about VIDEODROME when it came out in 1982, but now it makes a pretty succinct statement that can pretty easily be tied to the horrors of social networking - from the inarguable prediction about ""screen names"" and beyond.While I'm seeing a lot of people call the dialogue in this ""atrocious"", I truly found it to be some of the most intellectual and intriguing dialogue I have heard in a while. It honestly feels like you are reading a philosophy book the entire time. Considering how out-there the material is, the entire cast did a really phenomenal job sculpting out bizarre personality types that feel as if they may not exist at all YET, but certainly could in the future. Viggo Mortensen definitely steals the show with such a unique approach to a human character that it feels entirely alien. Lea Seydoux held things down as expertly as she always does, and Lihi Kornowski, Scott Speedman, and Don McKellar made great impressions on me for the first time.While the movie isn't thrilling enough to be considered any form of masterpiece, it fits in very well with Cronenberg's final decade of body horror: the 90's. This makes perfect sense since the movie was originally written in 2002, and put on hold for 20 years. (Noting this, it makes it even more impressive that the plot still feels so ahead of it's time.) This movie feels most like eXisTeNz and Naked Lunch, with hints of Crash and Videodrome. But, if you loved Dead Ringers, you should be able to get plenty into Crimes Of The Future - it's ""slower"" than a lot of classic Cronenberg, but all the elements of classic Cronenberg are there.I went in expecting a film that was all aesthetic with no heart, but I was fully proven wrong. Cronenberg is not facing Dario Argento syndrome in the way that I feared he would. David Cronenberg still has the heart and mind of an artist, and it is fully clear through Crimes of the Future. It's challenging, visceral, and feels pretty gross to watch, as it is meant to be. Much of the film feels like a reflection on David's existence as an artist himself, but its primary appeal is as an exploration of bizarre but very possible elements of our own future world. Kudos, Cronie."
290,Crimes of the Future,7," Don't spill:Greetings again from the darkness. So, what happens when society evolves to the point that pain barely exists? Well, of course, people will then desire pain for pleasure and will go to extremes to experience the new forbidden bruised fruit. Anyone familiar with filmmaker David Cronenberg's 40+ year career is already anticipating 'what else' the master of 'body horror' and twisted provocations will add to the proceedings. And the answer is ... plenty.Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, and Lea Seydoux co-stars as Caprice, his performance art partner with benefits (such as they may be). If you've ever wondered what a second career for a trauma surgeon might look like, well Caprice's role in the live shows is to first tattoo and then remove the newest organ that Saul's body has generated - all while the appreciative audience looks on as if Picasso were painting or Edith Piaf were singing. Wait, what? His body grows new organs? Yes, Cronenberg has set this in a future where a segment of the population has an evolved digestive system and mutations, pain has been mostly eradicated, and Saul's body grows new organs that may or may not have a legitimate function - they're never left in the body long enough to find out because it's Show time!An opening sequence features a young boy's inexplicable action, which leads his mother to an unfathomable next step. We are clearly in a (not so bright) future and Cronenberg delivers his first crime. That boy is linked to one of the many sub-plots in the film, though it's Saul and Caprice who are at the center of most. A secretive government agency is responsible for registering all new organs, and it's run by Wippet (Don McKellar) and Timlin (Kristen Stewart). Wippet worships Saul as an icon, while Timlin takes it a step further by whispering in Saul's ear, ""Surgery is the new sex."" Stewart plays polar opposite to her usual subtle on-camera style, delivering a humorous take on a curious, bird-like creature with tics and a lack of social graces.Outstanding supporting work comes from Scott Speedman, Welket Bungue, Tanaya Beatty, and Nadia Litz. I'll say little else about these characters or their story lines, because this film works best as you uncover each layer for yourself. A general description of the film would be what happens when anatomy and art collide with science-fiction. One can easily draw connective dotted lines between this Cronenberg film and many of his earlier ones. It has the bizarre sensuality of CRASH (1996), a nod to THE FLY (1986), common ground with EXISTENZ (1999), a line from DEAD RINGERS (1988), and social commentary in line from both VIDEODROME (1983) and SCANNERS (1981). This is Viggo Mortensen's fifth collaboration with Cronenberg, but surely the first where he's said, ""I'm not very good at old sex.""
Carol Spier's signature Production Design plays a significant part in the film, and best I can tell, she has worked on each of Cronenberg's films since 1981. The two Canadians make a good team. It's been 8 years since Cronenberg's last film, and the 79-year-old filmmaker is already in pre-production for his next. The Inner Beauty Pageant and Accelerated Evolution Syndrome are elements within this film, and as you would expect, he delivers visual effects that will stick with you. That said, nothing is over the top, and if anything, the cult filmmaker is on pretty good behavior, though he fully expects ""walk outs"" within the first few minutes. While I'm not sure the twist is even a twist, this is vintage Cronenberg offering no apologies while choosing to leave us with yet more of his provocations ... ""don't spill"".Opens in theaters on June 3, 2022."
291,Crimes of the Future,8," Misunderstood:I was in shock after this ended. All I could do was sit there and watch the credits roll. When I finally walked out, the usher said ""Wow, you survived,"" because multiple people walked out early. ""Survived"" is a very appropriate word for this, it's not something you watch, but endure. I get the strong sensation that Cronenberg is disillusioned with modern film and wanted to make his own attempt at progressing the art medium forward. With all of the discussion of corpses, body parts, and conflating art with mutilation, the message comes across clearly. The ""Crimes of the Future"" the title refers to are embracing the evolution of art and mutating human anatomy.In Cronenberg's dark and muddy dystopian future, police, bureaucrats, and conservatives are the enemy here, they prevent change at all costs because of fear. Whereas the ones willing to test the limits of art, their audience, and the human body are the trailblazers. The brooding lead, Saul, and his surgeon partner Caprice approach performance art in a way that illustrates this fear of evolution dichotomy; Saul rejects evolution out of disgust, but Caprice rejects the change out of fear. While their art is avant-garde, it does not push progressive boundaries the conservative bureaucracy believes. The process of embracing evolution occurs slowly over the course of Saul and Caprice's experiences in the grimy underworld of Cronenberg's complex dystopian future. There is no clear good or evil, only a hopeful destination that lies ahead, as the ending suggests."
292,Crimes of the Future,1," why is Viggo walking around in a ninja costume?:That should be renamed crimes against humanity. The director is just getting off in his old age, putting naked young girls on screen. Good for him. But it is clear to me Cronenberg detests life, humanity, any kind of spiritual existence, and just twists the subjective universe into grotesque tangents. I prefer to see the beauty of life. To elevate rather than put down. Problem is we are in a Cronenberg world now already, so none of this is satire. The true movie would have everyone being horrified at the grotesqueness of beautiful, blonde, white, chiseled people, while the goblins in the crowd gasp and faint."
293,Crimes of the Future,1, Don't believe the hype.:Truly awful. Boring story. Boring filming. Dull shots. Lifeless environments. Mediocre acting. No realistic or shocking gore. I'm well past dissapointment.
294,Crimes of the Future,1," I honestly don't know how this is rated so highly right now.:This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I went in not having watched a trailer or reading anything about it because trailers these days give so much away, and I like Cronenberg, so I was down for a sci-fi film with elements of horror. I don't know what I just watched. The first five minutes, my jaw was on the floor and I was ready to leave if it continued like that. It made me expect something along the lines of Mother or Climax. The rest of the movie? Terrible CGI effects, bad acting from Viggo Mortensen, story elements that made zero sense and way too much exposition about the wrong things. This movie came across as incredibly pretentious, it felt like a bunch of half thought out ideas, it tried to be shocking for the sake of it. It seemed like a film an art student made with a small studio budget. One scene looked like it could be a Chemical Brothers music video. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time that's genuinely bad. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just BAD."
295,Crimes of the Future,8," More thought-provoking than disturbing  but a solid watch regardless:After eight years, Cronenberg is finally back with the simple premise: what if humans could no longer feel pain? And, for the most part, he's able to expand on this idea to create one of his most interesting features, and a very welcome return to cinema. It's certainly a movie to avoid if you want something flat-out scary, but if you're looking for something more idea-driven, this could be a great watch.Normally, Cronenberg films can be divided into two distinct types: the spectacle-driven horror movies (Videodrome, Naked Lunch) and the ideological social dramas (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises). For a while they just existed as two very different phases of his career, miles apart in both tone and theme. But with Maps to the Stars, his previous film, Cronenberg created a bold and memorable mix of them: one moment is a disturbing encounter with a ghost, the next is social commentary on Hollywood celebrities.This trend continues in Crimes of the Future to an even more extreme degree, with disgusting body mutilations and musings on the nature of evolution existing side-by-side. It's one of his most intellectual features, deftly exploring the fascinating world he has created and letting the audience mull over its implications.The clinical direction and cinematography can understandably be off-putting to some people. But it helps create a sterile, almost casual atmosphere, one that does a good job of conveying the future's lack of emotional attachment to the human body. It's no longer a remarkable work of nature, but merely a blank slate that's to be molded however you wish.A movie like this can really fall apart if the acting's not up to par, but luckily the cast is uniformly great. They're all more than capable of selling this idea of a post-pain world in which humans rip out and mangle their own organs in front of entranced onlookers. Kristen Stewart has the most difficult job of everyone (for reasons that are too intriguing to spoil), and she absolutely nails it. She's awkward, funny, and disturbing in equal proportions. Although it is disappointing that she's somewhat underused in the movie, what little screen time she has is very effective.Is Crimes of the Future a perfect movie? Definitely not. It's overly indulgent at points, some of the supporting characters don't have a lot to do, and its message about humanity and technology doesn't have the resonance it should. But ultimately, the film accomplishes nearly everything it strives for: it's gross, psychologically stimulating, restrained in all the right ways, and a thoroughly satisfying film overall. I'm thrilled to see what Cronenberg does next.Final Score: 77/100."
296,Crimes of the Future,3, Dull and lack luster... a lot of missed potential:This is a cool concept but it was poorly executed and the story was not told very well. The visuals weren't as great as it was advertised and then the movie just suddenly ends without anything worth while happening. Overall it left me questioning whether this whole movie even needed to be made...the concept will draw you in but there is nothing that really holds your attention.
297,Crimes of the Future,8," A small but wonderful taste of a bizarre  fascinating future:One need not have seen all of David Cronenberg's films to quickly come to understand that consistent themes course through his most imaginative works. Body, mind, sex, and transformation are the core tenants of what Cronenberg does best. And these are integral to everything 2022's 'Crimes of the future' represents. I admit it's not quite what I thought it would be: not by way of quality, necessarily, but just in terms of how the content is structured. There is definite narrative here, yet it seems deemphasized, almost as though it's a distinctly secondary priority. This is accentuated by how some plot points are not fully realized, whether they're revealed with muddied clarity, or developed with a haphazard feel. More important here is the grand vision - the stitching together of a strange, tantalizing world, and all its moving parts. More than the concrete story, 'Crimes of the future' is built on presenting pockets of a new reality, and sewing them onto the canvas of the whole. It is, at varying points, engrossing, perplexing, stimulating, and or simply brilliant. It is absolutely not going to appeal to all viewers - but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a smile on my face throughout the whole length.It's not an outright flaw, but I will say I would personally have preferred a bit more attentiveness in the narrative writing. If the story is in fact complete and cohesive (and I'm not 100% sure it is), it doesn't always come across that way. Storytelling can make or break a title, and while that facet is (sufficiently) successful in this instance, the picture would have certainly benefited from tighter writing in that regard. I'd go so far as to say that the major critique that pops out at me about 'Crimes of the future' is that it just doesn't quite feel like Enough. Most of the jarring imagery we'd anticipate from a Cronenberg picture was shown to us in the first teaser trailer, and while we do get more detail to expand our in-universe knowledge, one almost gets a sense of having gotten only a sample, and not a full serving. By the same token, time that could have been spent exhibiting more of Saul Tenser's world is instead used to advance that narrative that to one degree or another seems unpolished, and even unfinished. The concepts are enticing, and the movie leaves us wanting much, much more - which is certainly to the filmmaker's credit, save for that I also feel like 'Crimes of the future' itself could have been more.On the other hand, otherwise Cronenberg's screenplay is fantastic, with complex and varied characters and rich, absorbing scene writing especially standing out. In fact, the latter may be the most crucial aspect of the entire production, as it informs the details that go into the story and the world-building. The future seen here is one that has been ruined by human mismanagement (all too real), but also one in which human culture and basic physiology has begun to shift. Those shifts are plainly unsettling as they present, yet anxious gut reactions are overshadowed by reason as the greatest extremes are indicated to be wholly willful, voluntary, and consensual - and by horror, not at pointedly grotesque displays, but at the parallels of steps the fictional government takes to curtail harmless private activities, or even progress that could be of genuine common good. The scene writing shows us glimpses of all these elements - culture, biology, technology, government, social relationships - and in so doing remains suitably diverse as to never lag or drag. It's a swirling, dazzling fancy that Cronenberg has put before us, and again I can only lament that we're not given still more.Beyond the writing, 'Crimes of the future' is impeccable. Cronenberg's direction - his eye for shot composition, and his guiding hand in instructing his cast and orchestrating scenes - remains as untarnished today as it it did in the 70s. Though lighting and cinematography lean into the dim, dark spaces, these are nonetheless lush and vibrant in their own right, making this film easy on the eyes, and pleasant. The costume design, hair and makeup work, blood and gore, and prosthetics are outstanding, as are the props and larger set pieces - veritable works of art, very well designed and crafted, and making this grim yet mesmerizing future setting feel all the more real. This is to say nothing of set design and decoration, filming locations - honestly, everything about the art direction and production design are terrific, and I love every bit of it. One would be remiss not to also highlight the original score of composer extraordinaire Howard Shore. Never taking the foreground, his themes are nonetheless an important part of the feature, lending much to the mood of any given scene and enriching the experience.Forgive my loquacity, but add to this a retinue of great performances. None are so grabbing as to demand lavish praise, yet everyone on hand excels in embodying their characters and bringing them to life, all carrying marvelous nuance, range, and physicality. Of course Viggo Mortensen stands out most of all, portraying complicated protagonist Saul with such a strong air of chronic pain and discomfort that one almost feels concern for Mortensen himself. Léa Seydoux is a joy, imbuing Caprice with a strength and personality that frankly exceeds the requirements of the role. Even in only small supporting parts, Don McKellar and Kristen Stewart impress in giving Wippet a notable nervous excitability - and Timlin, an even more striking mousy disposition that belies deep, stirring emotions.It would be easy enough to continue to pour over every last iota of the picture, but short of discussing specific plot points, the essence remains the same. 'Crimes of the future' reflects Cronenberg returning to the most wild recesses of his imagination, revisiting those themes and genre elements that have done so much to make his a recognizable name in horror circles. The spectacle to greet us is captivating, and the story intriguing, with a slight neo-noir sensibility to the scenario and characters - yet surprisingly, and perhaps disappointingly, a shade understated, and restrained. The furthest reaches of what the film could have been is not necessarily what we get - enough to give a taste of superb, flavorful ideas, but maybe not enough to totally satisfy. Still, even at that, even if the end result leaves me marginally discontented, much more so than not 'Crimes of the future' is an inventive, thought-provoking, bewitching, and entertaining cinematic experience. It may take a second view to pick up on some subtleties I hadn't discerned before, and more to the point, I'd like to see it again - and perhaps that says as much as anything could."
298,Crimes of the Future,4," A Complete miss:David Cronenberg films are very hit and miss for me. When he's good, he's great. When it's bad though it is usually terrible. 'Crimes of the Future' is a case of the latter. I don't know what this film was supposed to be but it missed on every level.I don't read the synopsis for films before I watch them if I can avoid it and I didn't for this film. But based on the title I had hopes for a dark and twisted film along the lines of 'Minority Report'. That's a film I would likely have enjoyed. I also saw there were walk-outs at Cannes film festival for this one. That had me excited, but no the gore and disturbing scenes are pretty mild I'm sad to say.Hard to find positives for this one. It's not funny, or clever, or scary or even disturbing. A film with very few redeeming qualities. 4/10."
299,Crimes of the Future,6," Hmmmm:Not sure I liked it, not sure I disliked it, but boy oh boy was it a Cronenberg movie, and if you like his style, check it out. My two biggest gripes are that I felt as though it ended too abruptly, and that honestly, I wish it was grosser. Is that weird? Most of the ""shocking bits"", besides one scene, were in the trailer, which was a bit disappointing. Really not much more that I can say. Great performances!"
300,Rogue One,10," My personal favourite Star Wars movie.:Granted, I haven't seen the original trilogy in some time, but as of right now this is the best of ALL Star Wars movies for me.I will not go into plotpoints because many other reviews on here do that excellently, but I will rather point out why I love this one so much.And that is because in this movie you can FEEL the stakes. In this one we SEE characters we love die. We see what it took to take down the empire.Our main hero Jyn doesn't get to live. She is a part of the giant picture and a part of what ultimately ends in the emperors demise.Basically all main characters of this movie die.An this is why this movie is so good."
301,Rogue One,10," An impressively dark 'Star Wars' story:Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death Star this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.As the film opens Imperial forces order scientist Galen Erso, who had been working as a farmer, to return to work on a new project. His wife is killed but his young daughter, Jyn, manages to escape. Fifteen years later news of the new weapon leaks out when an Imperial pilot defects while carrying a message from Galen. The pilot is held by a particularly radical rebel leader Saw Gerrera, the man who had helped save Jyn all those years ago. Jyn has lost contact with him but other rebels want her to help them get to Gerrera and learn the content of the message. Rebel officer Cassian Andor rescues Jyn from Imperial forces and they, along with K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, go to Gerrera. By now the Empire is fully aware that a pilot has defected with a message and they will do anything to stop the rebels using that information. Jyn sees the message and learns that her father built a weakness into the Death Star but to use it the rebels will need to steal the station's blueprints from an Imperial facility. After seeing what the Death Star can do many rebels want to give up but Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, the pilot and a few others decide that they will do what needs to be done whatever the personal cost and so a single stolen Imperial cargo ship, call sign 'Rogue One' sets off to find the plans.This is what the original prequel films should have been like. It is the darkest 'Star Wars' film to date; for once we see just how oppressive the Empire is; not just when dealing with rebels but as a brutal power of occupation. It also shows that the rebels are willing to do questionable things for what they see as the greater good of their cause. It might be thought there would be less sense of jeopardy as we've known for almost forty years that the rebels get their hands on the Death Star plans however since we haven't seen these characters before there the lingering question of why that might be is it just because they were doing other things or is it because they don't survive?! This question played on my mind throughout the film. As one would expect from a 'Star Wars' film there are plenty of exciting set pieces on a good variety of planets. The central cast are impressive; these include Felicity Jones, whose performance as Jyn I really enjoyed; Diego Luna who brings some believable ambiguity to the role of Cassian; and Alan Tudyk who provides the voice of K-2SO; one of the films best characters. The rest of the cast were pretty impressive too the only thing I was unsure about was the use of CGI to enable the late Peter Cushing to reappear as Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Carrie Fisher to appear as Princess Leia; the effects were pretty good but there was something of the 'uncanny valley' about them. There are plenty of enjoyably nods to the previous films; most notably some brief appearances from familiar characters; I also liked the nod to 'Zatoichi the blind swordsman' in the form of a blind Jedi played by Donnie Yen. I know that not everybody will like this but I really enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to any 'Star Wars' fan."
302,Rogue One,10, Best Star Wars film since episode 5:This had a ton of heart and story. Completely blows the new trilogy out of the water.
303,Rogue One,9," Best modern star wars:This felt like an original trilogy movie. The characters are amazing, action is beautiful, and story is solid."
304,Rogue One,10," This IS Star Wars. At its best.:What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars."
305,Rogue One,10, Raw model for syfy movies:In my opinion this is the best star wars movieThe should have more stand alone movies like this .. especially the end is great.
306,Rogue One,8," The Best Of The Disney-Era Star Wars Films:Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try."
307,Rogue One,10," So thankful for this film :) 10/10:This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you."
308,Rogue One,10," Far superior to JJ & Johnson's work.:This movie brings back why we all loved Star Wars in the first place. For those who remember watching the original in the cinema long, long ago in a cinema far away....it's brings a tear to the eyes, how they recapture the classic imagination that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson could not.
Thank you Garth Edwards, you have given back the fun where others have failed.
Johnson's 'Last Jedi' was just awfully bad."
309,Rogue One,9, Back to the roots:Rogue One is the movie we didn't asked for - but what we got was beyond any expectation. Excellent pacing of the movie. As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.CGI on the past main character seemed odd. But worked well on pilots and scoundrels. Many Easter eggs trough the whole movie are appreciated. Humor from Alan Tudyk's K-2SO was spot on.Empire Strikes Back is still king of the hill as the best SW movie till date. But Rogue One comes damn close near it.
310,Rogue One,10, Perfect:The people who did this need to do the other ones. They aren't very good but this was perfect. They took a known outcome and told us the story of what happened. I have no complaints about this movie. Highly recommend it.
311,Rogue One,10," Gareth Edwards has done it - The prequel story that Star Wars deserved.:With all the rumours flying about that Disney had interfered with the creative process on this one, just as when Alderaan blew up - I feared the worse. Fortunately my fears were unfounded. Rogue one is as engrossing as it is seamless and while its not perfect it had everything required to make a great movie. I guess everyone has different expectations of Star Wars. The plot which I will only briefly describe involves a group of rebels attempting to secure the plans to the Death Star, the designer of which, having a morale conscience, built the deliberate flaw (The exhaust port which Stewie Darth Vader asked about in Family Guy) so that it could be easily destroyed as long as the information fell into the right hands. This information is contained in an archive and it falls to the daughter of the designer, Jyn Erso, to not only restore her fathers name but get the designs to the rebels who are just itching to get on with events in Episode Four (New Hope) and blow the thing up.So does it hold up? Well, yes, not only does it hold up I would put this film on par with Empire and also Episode IV and this coming from someone who saw the first film on the silver screen in 1977. Gareth Edwards is a director who understands all the combined elements that make a Star Wars Film great. First a good script with the right mix of drama, action, pathos and humour and above all a story that actually makes sense, secondly good well written, rounded, characters that are interesting, diverse and unique, third great visuals - there's so many memorable shots in this film and so many of them are the shots you always wanted to see, fourth well directed action that looks and feels real, that is tense and that you can follow, fifth - tension, this film has it in spades, Sixth nods and references to the original trilogy - they come in abundance, some are comedic, some pure nostalgia while others are entirely appropriate and work so well within the story. Seventh - real sets, please give me a London Underground station redressed over bland CGI sterile sets any day of the week. Here the technology enhances the story and the tension and at no time tries to substitute for either. It is the perfect mix of live action & CG effects. I have not seen them so well combined since Lord of the Rings. This is a man who clearly understands his craft of what makes for a great film. I was highly critical of the prequel movies, which really are a masterclass in how not to make a film, here the total opposite is true. I am not a die hard Star Wars fan in any sense and was fully prepared to be very critical of this film, but find it hard to find fault in it anywhere. The supporting cast were especially good here, everyone from Riz Ahmed to Forest Whitaker giving it their all. The new villain of the piece is brilliantly played by Ben Mendelson (Hard to believe this is the kid from The Big Steal!) Donnie Yen's character was beautifully written, I could have watched another movie just about him alone. The cast feels truly international, as any universe should. Many British actors really make their mark in smaller roles including Duncan Pow & Ben Daniels as Rebel Foot Solider and General Pilot respectively while the likes of Sharon Duncan-Brewster & Jonathon Aris as Rebel Senators argue the merits of the attack in a tense conference debate - gone are the boring council meetings of the prequels. Strong drama is the key ingredient of the day. Here the Rebellion is shown as a far more tangible real faction, not everyone agrees with each other, things get messy and sometimes the wrong people are killed - the film even begs to ask the question, how better really are they than the Empire??? - we know of course, but its great to see such shades rather than just plain good and bad guys.The film contains so many pure Star Wars moments. I have no doubt the Droid (Voiced with skill by Alan Tudky) will become a favourite of many and new aliens and ship designs are not thin on the ground.Chiefly in the acting credits, plaudits must go to Felicity Jones who plays Jyn with real conviction while Diego Luna avoids a Han Solo portrayal of Cassian, her would be ally and sometimes adversary. The appearances of Vader and Tarkin (Incredible) are entirely warranted and in proportion with the rest of the film.One or two of the subplot characters are a little underwritten (perhaps deleted scenes and a longer cut will reveal them to be less so) but that really is nit picking, I had no issue with this at all. To juggle so many major and minor characters in a single narrative in a tight running time, for any director is no mean feat and Edwards manages it extremely well. I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story - Whatever were his obstacles, he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class."
312,Rogue One,8," A rebellion well worth saving:Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Personally actually loved 'The Force Awakens', despite the vitriolic hate it's got.The latest 'Star Wars' entry, which is somewhat of a prequel, 'Rogue One' is a worthy prequel but seems to be intended as a standalone chapter and it actually fares even better in this regard. 'Rogue One' is not as good as the original trilogy, not being as much as a genre landmark or as influential but is certainly better than any of the prequel trilogy films combined and along with 'The Force Awakens' one of the better 'Star Wars' films since 'The Return of the Jedi'. With this being said, 'Rogue One' is going to be reviewed as if considered a standalone chapter.'Rogue One' has so many good things, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4/10 at least. For one thing, the production values (with a couple of exceptions) are amazing. Particularly good are the special effects, which are not only of outstanding and astonishingly real quality but actually drive and enhance the story and helps provide some great visual story-telling. It's wonderfully shot too, the cinematography being some of the most memorable and beautifully composed and transitioned of the year. 'Rogue One' similarly boasts a rousing, sometimes dream-like and atmospheric score from the always dependable Michael Giacchino, one misses John Williams of course and having a different composer takes some getting used to for someone who grew up with Williams' iconic themes, but Giacchino is a worthy replacement.Also impressive is a script that treats its audience with respect, rather than talking down, being bland and soulless or so dumbed down that it lacks brains. Tension, humour, action and pathos are beautifully balanced, the references and nod a delight for any 'Star Wars' fan and written in a way that is affectionate rather than shoe-horned. The story never felt dull (to me), maintaining a snappy pace and with a lot of heart and tension. There is a great combination of what made the original trilogy so great, something that Gareth Edwards fully understood, while having its own identity, this is not a re-hash yet there is an affectionate nostalgia reminiscent of the original trilogy's spirit. It makes sense, and is darker, more poignant and richer than the whole saga has been in a long time.Then there is the action, which is thrilling and has a real sense of purpose. The last forty minutes in particular are thrillingly epic. Nice to see footage of Peter Cushing and even more wonderful was seeing one of cinema's most iconic villains Darth Vader making an appearance magnificently voiced as ever by James Earl Jones.Mainly the cast are strong, with a feisty and likable heroine in Felicity Jones' Jyn, terrific support from Diego Luna and especially Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn's sterlingly played villain. The best characters are K-2SO, the wisecracking robot played with terrific comic timing and gusto by Alan Tudyk, and Chirrut, beautifully realised and 'Rogue One's' most interesting character characterised splendidly by Donnie Yen.Not without its faults by all means. Some characters are underused and underdeveloped, a few like Forrest Whittaker's (pretty wasted) Gerrera being pointless. Some of the pacing is jumpy and rushed which comes at the expense of making a cast of perhaps too many characters more consistently interesting.Design and CGI for Tarkin is ropey and distractingly artificial. While it was nice to see younger Leia again, it was cheaply recreated and like Tarkin sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the visuals, which were otherwise amazing as said.Overall, worthy prequel and a very good standalone chapter. A rebellion well worth saving. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
313,Rogue One,," The acting  plot  themes and film pacing was perfect.:*Spoiler/plot- Rogue ONE, 2016. The Rebel Alliance takes a risky chance to steal the operation plans for the Empire's Death Star after it known that main Empire construction scientist, Galen Erso built purposely a flaw into the planet killing device as a safeguard to galactic freedom. He is killed, but his only daughter, Jyn Erso takes on this quest with Alliance support.*Special Stars- Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen, Alan Tudyk, Forest Whitaker, Jimmy Smits. CGI cameos- Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher.*Theme- Rebellions are built on hope and audacity.*Trivia/location/goofs- Disney produced. The film only starts with traditional text, ""A long time ago in a galaxy far away"". No explanatory screen craw at the film's beginning. Locations: Iceland, Jorden, and Pacific islands. Film shows the plot just before the original Star Wars film with Luke meeting Leia.*Emotion-I was purposely very slow to see and review this film. Primarily because of my disappointment with the last Star Wars film with 'Daisy' as her slick manufactured female role model star for little girls. This film was a complete opposite in it's emotional connection to the audience. It has all the heroic spirit of the first SW films. The acting, plot, themes and film pacing was perfect. The CGI was a subtle tool used to advance the plot when needed, and not another director's toy. The Death Star matters in their destructive scope were excellent. And the space battle scenes were exhilarating and exciting. Let's keep this up for the next SW shows, OK ? *Based On- A screenplay and the Star Wars universe. in the Star Wars universe."
314,Rogue One,9," Best Disney era movie by far and one of the franchise strongest:A scientist is forcibly recruited by the Empire to help build the Death Star.In my opinion Rogue One is (to date) the best Star Wars movie produced in the Disney era and one of the strongest entries in the overall franchise. I enjoyed it for its darker tone, excellent performances and in particular how well it fits into the overarching narrative of the Star Wars universe.There are a number of memorable scenes, particularly in the final act which packs a double emotional wallop with the fate of the main characters and what we know is to come in events portrayed in the original 1977 Star Wars movie.The action sequences and visuals are fantastic throughout, with a strong combination of great cinematography, sensible computer generated imagery and effective fight choreography. It's difficult to go into detail about the best bits without major spoilers so I'll just say they get the fan service spot on with a great blend of the old and the new.All performances are solid with Felicy Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk all compelling as the main antagonists. Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen give great support. The standout performances for me are Ben Mendelsohn as a memorable villain and Forrest Whitaker in a slightly unhinged cameo.Any fans of the original trilogy should enjoy this one, particularly when compared to the prequel and sequel movies which largely miss the mark."
315,Rogue One,9," Rogue One Review:Rogue One is the first Star Wars film to be set outside the Episodic Sagas. With that, there was a lot of pressure on it to perform and launch this new series of Star Wars films.By far, this is the least kid friendly film. This was at it's core, a war film, something we have never really gotten in the Star Wars universe. With the war theme we got an overall darker tone than we are use to, and it really suited the story they were telling. We never have experienced the war side of Star Wars because the stories have always been focused on a force user rather than the events around them. Because there are no jedi, we got to see more of the Rebellion and the Empire and the battle that is taking place during the original trilogy.Offsetting the darker tone of the film, I thought this was perhaps the funniest Star Wars film. There are so many one liners and comedic moments that brings a lighter tone to the darker moments. I think much of the comedic moments came from the droid character K2SO. For the most part, he was the comedic relief and because of that, you are drawn to his character and is a stand out.While still on the cast and characters, I thought they were near perfect. While the characters themselves aren't as fleshed out as we get during the saga films, for the role themselves, they served their purpose. Apart from K2SO, I thought Donnie Yen's character, Chirrut was a close second standout. I really enjoyed his character because of his connection into the Star Wars law.How much you enjoy Rogue One is, for the most part, going to depend how deep you invested you are into the world of Star Wars. As someone who read Cataylst in the lead up to Rogue One, I felt as though my experience during this film was enhanced so much. There were so many moments that was so much meaningful and heartfelt because I knew the backstory to some of these events and characters. There is also a lot fan service in Rogue One that on paper, it seems like it's too much. But what stood out was that not one of the fan services felt shoed in. All of it felt like it had a place in the movie and should of been there regardless of if it was a fan service moment or not.Walking out of this film, you are going to be on a high and that is because of the fantastic third act this film has. Rogue One has a third act that will rival that of Return of the Jedi. This is one of the best space battle I have ever seen. While I love the one in Return of the Jedi, personally I rank the opening battle from Revenge of the Sith above it. However, the space battle in Rogue One beats them all. It had the feel that Return of the Jedi brought in their space battle but with the action and visual effects the space battle in Revenge of the Sith.Stepping back from the space battle, the third act has a terrific ground level fight. This was where the war tone was heavily present. This was a scene we see in a WWII war film but with a Star Wars skin. There's no better way to describe it, and that is a good thing. What really enhanced the war toned ground fight was how well it was edited between the action happening on the ground and the spectacle of a space battle happening above them.I have to mention Vader. While he isn't in it all that much, when he is, his presence is felt. Without giving so much away, his final scene is perhaps one of my favourite scenes I have ever seen. The short scene alone rivals the Airport scene in Captain America: Civil War for me. It is so exciting that it has the capability to make any major Star Wars fans cry with happiness.Overall, I loved this movie. This did what it need to do and prove that they can make Star Wars films that isn't all lightsabers and Skywalkers. But what this film does the best is enhance A New Hope. As soon as I walked out the cinema I wanted to go and watch A New Hope. Personally, I really struggle with watching A New Hope but with Rogue One it makes me excited to go back and watch the original Star Wars.9/10"
316,Rogue One,10," By far  my favourite Star Wars.:By far, my favourite of the Star War movies. Great CGI. Epic soundtrack. Human stories. Great performances. Many wonderful cameos. Heroism at great cost. The power of hope. This was my second viewing of many more to come. I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}"
317,Rogue One,9," Diamond in the Rough:Rogue One is a surprise diamond in the rough. Though the film lacks the flair (minimal lightsabers) and wit (barely any humor) of other Star Wars films, it fits the narrative being told. The cinematography is Rogue One is crisp and the dialogue is generally pretty good. The tone is serious and the characters fully embrace the severity of the situation. There are duller moments, particularly in the first two acts, but the story comes full circle in the end.I've said it before and I'll say it again, Star Wars knows how to execute killer third acts. The finale of this film is no different, and might be the best climax in the franchise other than RoTS. Everything that happens after the shield opens on Scarif is anxiety inducing. Though we have a short time to develop relationships with these characters, the connections are strong as we watch their fight for hope.Rogue One is one of those movies that did not need to be made, but I am glad that it was. I try to stray away from using the word ""perfect"" in these reviews, but this film is the perfect segue into the original trilogy.Best Character: Cassian Andor
Best Moment: The Vader slaughter.Best Quote: ""It's not a problem if you don't look up."" That was Jyn's response when asked about the Empire's rule and the Imperial flag flying. This single line adds needed depth and understanding to her character."
318,Rogue One,9, Wowwww:This is the movie I'll tell Everyone I fell in love with .for me it was amazing felicity Jones was truly amazing and the rest of the cast .vadar scenes were awesome but even if you remove them it's still an awesome movie up there with the Empire strikes back
319,Rogue One,8," An example for future Star Wars movies:Rogue One feels like a serious and grounded movie, with a plot that weighs a ton, that feels important on every scale from the very beginning and as the movie progresses it shows that it's on another level, much higher.The plot is very well written. It's simple, but direct, without fillers or unnecessary diversions. The levels of politics are reduced to the minimum so that it remains a factor to consider, but from the farthest box possible. It has impressive action sequences supported by flawless visual effects, such as the battle of Scarif, the battles of the ships and the devastating power of the Death Star. As if that were not enough, the film has cameos that have a very important presence.On the technical side, the soundtrack is very good as usual, but the sound editing also stands out tremendously. Photography is beautiful! Even from the first introductory scene of that ringed planet. The editing is also very efficient and its highest point is in the last third of the film, where there is a very fast pace as we get into the battles.The few negative points are found in specific decisions regarding the performances and the non-existent development of some secondary characters.This is a work that makes even those who most resist the fury of this old saga (like me) turn their eyes to this great action and science fiction show."
320,Rogue One,7," Emotion   thrills   noisy action   super-spectacle and impressive aerial combat effects:Set after the rise of the Galactic Empire in Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and before the Battle of Yavin in Star Wars (1977) .

With a desperate goal of saving her daddy from the Empire and retrieving the secret plans for the weapon of mass destruction : The Death Star, we follow a group of rebel spies (Felicity Jones , Diego Luna as Cassian Andor , Donnie Yen as Chirrut Îmwe , Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus , Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook) and including the ordinary robot : K-2SO (voice : Alan Tudyk) , an Imperial enforcer droid who's been re-purposed to work for the rebellion. All of them have hope to restore peace to the Galaxy , being commanded by the high staff (Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa , Fares Fares as Senator Vaspar , Alistair Petrie as General Draven , Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma , Ben Daniels as General Merrick , Ian McElhinney as General Dodonna) and to vanquish Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and other empire enemies as well as eliminate the destructive super-weapon or it will be too late . A risky rebellion built on hope . Save the Rebellion. Save the dream.Delightful follow-up to the trilogy that George Lucas always said was intented to be for children . However , because of its imagination , scale , spectacularity , and style , it results to be a fabulous entertainment for all ; both , kiddies and adults . Interesting and engaging screenplay by Chris Weitz , Tony Gilroy from a story by John Knoll , and based on characters created by George Lucas . And being the first Stars Wars franchise to introduce location on-screen caption . Some marvellous new creations , especially state-of-art robots , and the unbeatable special effects more than make up for a slighly overlong movie . Although it is more a spin-off than a sequel , it is more different and original than its predecessors ; if it's no less enjoyable or uplifting . To wonder at the way in which heroes and heroines steer their aircrafts and fall off in high-speed against the large enemy crafts . And the breathtaking dogfighting and overwhelming piloting at the end restore it to the realm of super-spectacle to which it belongs . Felicity Jones is acceptable as Jyn Erso joining the Alliance, Jyn finds herself in the middle of the ultimate conflict between the Rebels and the Empire as well as to cripple a super-weapon . She is well accompanied by an enjoyable support cast , such as : Forest Whitaker , Riz Ahmed , Mads Mikkelsen , Jimmy Smits ,Genevieve O'Reilly and many others . Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing in Star wars is now played by Guy Henry with a CGI replica of Cushing's face superimposed over his . And special appearance by Darth Vader , voice: James Earl Jones, who is meticulously patterned after his look in the original ""Star Wars"". And Carrie Fisher-CGI Leia (Ingvild Deila, voice: Carrie Fisher) who is asked what the plans mean and she answers , ""Hope,"" signaling the start of the first Star Wars film... Star Wars (1977) . However , Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), and Drewe Henley (Red Leader) all passed away in 2016.It displays an attractive production design , over-the-top scenarios , appropriate photography and adequate costuming , as costume designer David Crossman stated that some of the original costumes used in Star wars (1977), The empire strikes back (1980) and The return of the Jedi (1983) were reused here . It packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Greig Fraser And rousing musical score from Michael Giacchino , taking parts of original soundtrack by the classy John Williams ; Michael has composed every film directed by J.J. Abrams except Star wars episode VII , though composer Alexandre Desplat's original score was rejected . Michael Giacchino, his replacement, had only one month to write his musical score. The motion picture was well directed by Gareth Edwards who exposed their three of his influences for film-making are George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino. He has made succesful films , as the hit of ""Monsters"" resulted in Edwards getting offers from the major studios, especially Warner Bros., who tapped him to direct an English-language reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic ""Gojira"", being produced by Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures, directing the successful ""Godzilla¨ . Finally directed this ¨Rogue one¨, a tremendous box office hit smash , grossing a lot of money worldwide ."
321,Rogue One,10," That rarity:That rarity, a decent Star Wars film. Apart from this one all the most recent movies have been poor
This feels like a return to basics, a return to it's roots.
This is my favourite, after the very first/original movie."
322,Rogue One,10," The Best ""Star Wars"" Saga Since ""The Empire Strikes Back!"":Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" exemplifies this notion. Basically, ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards, ""Golden Compass"" scenarist Chris Weitz, and ""Bourne"" trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan ""Star Wars"" saga. No, the PG-13 rated ""Rogue One"" is neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I've read about this entry in the ""Star Wars"" universe emphasizes the word 'stand-alone' so you won't be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn't apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, ""Rogue One"" may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you've seen George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,"" then you know that the Death Star didn't survive that adventurous classic. ""Rogue One"" qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope."" Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn't know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in ""Rogue One"" occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of ""Frankenstein"" fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing's estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor's personage, and actor Guy Henry's impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they've accomplished, he'd be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney's audacious attempt to expand the ""Star Wars"" time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.Since ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope"" came out back in the summer of 1977, fans have complained about the sweet spot in the Death Star that enabled the Alliance to blow it up. ""Rogue One"" relates the story about that sweet spot, and ""Star Wars"" aficionados can argue about other things—primarily the time-line between the two films—because Luke and Leia were born at the end of ""Episode III."" Nevertheless, who really cares about such things, when a movie like ""Rogue One"" fills the gap? Aside from Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, and Princess Leia, the primary characters in ""Rogue One"" are entirely new to the franchise. A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of ""Dr. Strange""), has been forced against his will to collaborate with the Empire to forge the ultimate weapon of devastation. The wicked Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn of ""Killing Them Softly"") has commandeered Galen for the project, and he intends to use Galen's wife Kyra (Valene Kane of ""Victor Frankenstein"") and his adolescent daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) as bargaining chips. Galen sends his daughter into hiding, and Kyra perishes trying to thwart Orson. Jyn grows up under the tutelage of an extreme radical, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker of ""Platoon""), and she becomes a notorious criminal who has been imprisoned when the Rebel Alliance rescues her. It seems that an Empire pilot, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") has defected and given himself up to Saw. Bodhi insists that he has an urgent message from Galen Erso about the Death Star. Naturally, nobody believes the Empire could have forged such an awesome weapon. The Rebel Alliance isn't prepared to be so casual about this booger bear. Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna of ""Blood Father"") and his reprogrammed Empire Droid K-2so (voice of Alan Tudyk of ""Serenity"") break Jyn (Felicity Jones of ""Brideshead Revisited"") out captivity when she is being transferred to a labor camp. Later, as Jyn explains to Saw, the Rebel Alliance is using her for safe passage into Saw's camp on the planetary moon Jedha where Bodhi is being held captive. Saw surprises Jyn with a holographic message from Galen intended for her. Galen explains that the Death Star has the equivalent of an Achilles' Heel that will render it vulnerable to the Rebels. No sooner has Jyn seen this message than the Grand Moff Tarkin brings the Death Star into orbit around Jedha and unleashes its formidable power on the city. During their rushed exit from Jedha, Cassian and Jyn pick up a pair of hitchhikers, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen of ""Iron Monkey 2"") and his sidekick Base Malbus (Wen Jiang of ""Let the Bullets Fly""), who become recruits for the cause. Chirrut is a blind martial arts warrior who wields a lethal staff and believes in the Force with all his heart.""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" depicts the efforts of the underdog Rebel Alliance to triumph over the Empire. Basically, this exciting escapade works on the level of a Republic Serial from the 1940s with one cliffhanger scene after another ensuing in a grand finale on a scenic Caribbean-like island named Scarif where the star fleets of the both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire wage the battle to end all battles. Although it doesn't rely on the usual troika of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, ""Rogue One"" imitates ""Star Wars"" in virtually every respect except its ending with a Pyrrhic Victory. Felicity Jones makes a sympathetic heroine that you won't forget. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO compete as the ultimate scene stealers. The special effects are stellar stuff. Altogether, ""Rogue One"" qualifies as the best ""Star Wars"" epic since ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
323,Rogue One,8," Great Prequel to New Hope:I've just returned from the midnight showing of Rogue One here in the UK. I was slightly sceptical after watching Force Awakens, while enjoyed FA it did lack teeth and flesh.Rogue one was a great prequel to New Hope.We know that Princess Leigh had the death star plans but how did she get them ??.Well now we know.A few minutes into the film I felt disappointed that there was no Star Wars theme or rolling credits. Once I got past this the film started coming to life and put you right into the star wars universe. There were nudges to the originals everywhere, old characters from New Hope were brought to live to return to the big screen.There was plenty of visual eye candy here and a climactic ending that was truly stunning. I want to watch it again to see all the little details.This is a dark and emotional film compared to others but it has its light hearted moments also.Without giving too much away we follow a rag tag bunch fighting against the Empire and Lord Vader. A lost girl, a rebel agent, a defector, a novice trainee of the force, a hot shot gunner and a reprogrammed imperial robot. Alongside the rebel alliance they discover the existence of the Empires latest super weapon and must a find a way to destroy it. The Bad - 1.Some of the dialogue is wooden but this goes for all Star Wars film. 2. There is a lull in action about midway through and the dark scenes at this point may bore some people.3. No JediThe Good - 1. Amazing climactic ending a real visual treat.2. Ties in really well to New Hope.3. Interesting characters not your typical heroes which makes them more interesting.4. I got emotional at the end xIf your a fan of the originals then don't miss this film. My Star Wars marathon just got better ( and bigger )8/10 xx"
324,Rogue One,10, This may actually be the best star wars movie ever made.:Of course that sounds like heresy but in fact I will go one further and say that it IS the best star wars movie ever made. Followed by Empire
325,Dune: Part One,9," DUNE - A Great Modern Sci-Fi:Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it's one of the best stories I've ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn't enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It's kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I've seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It's epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn't get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could've dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I've been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It's finally here, it's gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it's two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it's still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It's most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template."
326,Dune: Part One,10," My movie of 2021  so far.:It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10."
327,Dune: Part One,9," ""He shall know your ways as though born to them."":It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time."
328,Dune: Part One,8," Grandiose visuals and great acting with little story background:To be honest I wasn't expecting it to be a first episode in the series of films, so that was a disappointment at first - but then I realised it's just impossible to put whole book in one movie in any meaningful way (with all my love to the Lynch's version, it didn't do the book much justice), so splitting the story into several parts is actually a good decision.Problem is, even with this division the film doesn't really provide much of the background details on who all the characters are, what's the state of the world, why spice is actually important to the navigators, who are the navigators and many many different important well-thought aspects that make the book so great. Instead there are long scenes focused on the main character, surroundings, futuristic machinery and so on.There are two more outcomes of such screen usage:
1. It all looks absolutely gorgeous and amazingly well designed - ""firefly"" fighters are incredible, harvesters and their delivery is awesome, and many other things are equally stunning. And oh, the costumes! The costumes are the best.2. Major actors playing secondary characters don't get much time at all - they're all playing their roles very well, but we barely see them at all (save perhaps Jason Momoa, but even his screen time is scarce).Overall it's a great cinematographic feat, and the best Dune adaptation so far - but we'll have to wait the rest of it to see if it holds true. I only wish they'd put more world-building details into the narrative..."
329,Dune: Part One,9," Amazing cinematic experience:Greetings from Lithuania.""Dune. Part I"" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!"
330,Dune: Part One,9," Faithful retelling of the book  perhaps too faithful?:Dont get me wrong, the movie does everything right in bringing the book to life. The visuals are gorgeous and Frank Herbert's work is clearly understood and respected. But there is something slightly off, cant really put my finger on it. While the attempt David Lynch made (Dune, 1984) was a bit too out there and the filmmaker took too many liberties, Denis Villeneuve (Dune, 2021) was perhaps a bit too determined to not make the same mistake twice.Ive read the book a few months ago so I was still perfectly aware how the story develops. This made the film, dare I say it, a bit on the slow and dull side here and there. This was, like I said, more than made up by the gorgeous visuals and sounds, but I cant shake the thought that the story could have been told in a slightly more energetic way.All in all, a small complaint, and people who are new to the franchise, which I suspect will be many, perhaps do not feel that way. In the end I left the theatre more than satisfied, so still a 9/10 for me."
331,Dune: Part One,8," The Beginning:Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road."
332,Dune: Part One,9," Fear Is The Mind-Killer:Just watched one of the first screenings of 'Dune' at an IMAX cinema and damn, that were some of the best two and half hours of my life. I was hyped for this movie from the moment it was announced since I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve - but also because the story really spoke to me in a special sense. I haven't read the books, so this experience was very original and new for me.I was amazed when I heard about the amazing cast that was going to be in this film. When I saw them in action I was even more amazed, overwhelmed even. Every one of these top-tier actors brought their A-game to the set of 'Dune' and this makes the characters so much more interesting. The person the amazed me the most was Rebecca Ferguson. Her portrayal of Lady Jessica was absolutely outstanding.The visuals and cinematography in this movie were out of this world. You'd almost think that they actually filmed on different planets. You could pause the movie at any point in time and you would always be looking at a beautiful painting of its own. The sets were incredible, so were the special effects. You can really tell people worked hard on this.Hans Zimmer's score was pristine (as always). It really brought the universe of 'Dune' to life by creating a unique atmosphere of its own. The sound design was also incredible. I was a big fan of the loud, obscure sounds that were coming from many of the gigantic ships. It really gave you and idea of how large in scale this story is.As far as the story goes, I don't know if I can give a good opinion. I haven't read the books nor watched the previous adaptions, so I don't know if this adaption stayed true to the original. All I can say is that this story really pulled me in from the get go and didn't let go until a few hours after the movie ended. And I'm still not over it. I rate this movie 9/10 because I absolutely adore it, missing the one point because the ending didn't really feel like an ending. I truly hope part two gets made because this story deserves to be completed."
333,Dune: Part One,9," I MUST NOT BE AFRAID:Dune is an amazing movie. One of the best special effects ever. A crazy photograph that makes you love and hate the Dune desert at the same time. Villeneuve reaches its peak, demonstrating skill in managing the action scenes and making the slower scenes interesting, inevitable for the transposition of Herbert's novel. The very compelling storyline and the phenomenal cast. Hans Zimmer leaves us one of the best soundtracks of him. It's a movie to see, to see at the cinema! Only time will tell if we are faced with a masterpiece, but it has everything in order to become one. And remember it's part one."
334,Dune: Part One,8," Villeneuve epic:Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timothée Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader."
335,Dune: Part One,8," A proper epic:I grew up watching the 1984 movie and had seen it a hundred times before I even knew the book(s) existed... :) so to me, this movie feels like ""a remake"" and not ""a new adaptation of the book.""Naturally, I can't help but compare the films.The pacing is much slower here, and I feel it gives the story a ""proper epic"" feel without going full Peter Jackson (The Hobbit/3 movies).There are enough differences between the two to constantly keep things interesting, though I feel some things are better explained in the 1984 version (less confusion and explaining things to my wife).Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this version, as I wasn't super-excited by the the first trailer.Given the strange economics of today's movie world, I'm not sure how the studio will decide whether or not to go ahead with Part 2 ... but I intend to vote with my dollars by seeing this at the theater at least one more time.Thanks!"
336,Dune: Part One,9," The beginning of an epic saga.:As a 70-year-old film fanatic, seeing Dune for the first time impressed me at least as much as my first encounter with Lotr or Star Wars. The dark and austere visuals, far removed from the previous film version of Dune, contributed to this ""epic"" feeling. Classy."
337,Dune: Part One,9," Love letter to Dune fans  beautiful cinema to film fans:To film fans - A very beautiful and well written film, unfortunately falls a little towards the end after a strong start, and robust progression.However this is a 2 part film so proceed to the movie with that mindset, because there is going to be a lot more in the 2nd featurette.Perfect casting, perfect performance. There was a difficulty in understanding the words from some of the characters.Unsure if this was a creative decision or editing error, but the movie looked too dim at some parts and could use a bit more brightness I feel, to capture facial expressions and setting better, nevertheless the cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have seen, this truly is picturesque beautiful like the milky way at night.To Dune fans - Frank Herbert would be so happy, the film captures the novel's spirit, and you will truly feel Paul's wit, anger, sadness and journey to Muad'Dib, thanks to Timothee Chalamet and the production.Expect few minor changes; Sardaukars are more dangerous, Baron doesn't look as disgusting, Fremens are much accurate and cooler, memorable lines from the novel are not in the film, dialogues spoken from different characters than the original from the novel.We all know how difficult it is to adapt Dune, if people though Lord of the Rings was hard, they clearly never read Dune. Do not expect perfection because the lore is so deep, it would require multiple prequels, or a prelude to Dune prologue explaining the vast universe of it. All and all, you are going to love it.Looking forward to the 2nd part, and hopefully the rest of Frank Herbert's Dune in movies."
338,Dune: Part One,9," Spectacular and immersive:Nitpics aside, this is a movie with amazing production design, a powerful score, masterful visual effects and phenomenal perfomances. As a fan of the book I can say that it delivered the story in way I didnt expect. It streamlined certain events yet managed to communicate the core messages of the book.I do believe however, that the soundtrack albeit BEAUTIFUL was sometimes undercut by the excessive ambience.(It didnt bother any of my friends though, so it might be a ME thing). Also ,I think that we could have had the ending about 10 minutes earlier. Some say that it ended abruptly but in all honesty the point where the story stopped seemed logical to me. It might be because I have read the book.It was a long ride but a suspenceful one. It might not be for everyone but it certainly was for me.Overall, It is truly a testament to the potential of science fiction and I cant wait for part 2."
339,Dune: Part One,9, Just really enjoyed it:Takes it time to actually build a story and not rush thingsgreat cgigreat musicnice fighting scenesgreat actorsawesome movie atmosphereCan definitely recommend it.
340,Dune: Part One,9," Beautifully crafted movie:A movie made for the big screen. The sound design is great and Hans Zimmer is awesome as always. The visuals are pretty good too, considering everything plays out on a rather mundane sand planet. The visual effects are perfect.Dune is like Villeneuve's other movies rather slow and I almost fell asleep a few times, but other than that it was an awesome experience.The casting was great and the acting was on point. The story was very interesting and made me want to see more."
341,Dune: Part One,9," An enjoyable adaption of the first book:In this movie, roughly the first half of the book is adapted to a movie, and it totally works. The flow of the story is continuous, the tension is kept throughout the movie. I have to applaud the costume design, because they managed to make every aspect (characters, places, ships) sparkle and shine. One thing that might let some people down is the fact that the trailer makes it seem like there is a lot of action in the movie. What I found was that, while there was action in the movie, it wasn't as much as the trailer led me to believe. Any fan of the book(s) will absolutely be content with the movie."
342,Dune: Part One,9," ""DUNE"" Makes a spectacular viewing experience.:From the director of ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"", comes another sci-fi epic ""DUNE: Part One"" based on the novel.It's the year of 10191. There are different planets with different species of human. Our main character Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the future of House Atreides. He is on an adventure to Arrakis, a beautiful planet that produces spies and full of dangerous sandworms.This is all I can say without spoilers. The thing about DUNE is it's stunning direction and breathtaking cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual image. Not to mention the amusing score (by Hans Zimmer).I watched DUNE in IMAX. Frequent shots of enormous spaceships and battle sequences are always a pleasure throughout. The making of this movie should be rightfully appreciated.It's a movie forcing the audience to pay attention, in a good way. The plot takes time to digest but once you know what's going on, it's a lot of fun.A lot of characters are introduced. Gurney (Josh Brolin), Glossu (Dave Bautista), Duncan (Jason Momoa) and I could go on. During it's 155 minute runtime however, not everyone gets enough characterization. I'd like to see certain characters explored more. Maybe in the sequel.After all DUNE is still a beautiful sci-fi movie. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's still a great piece of modern filmmaking."
343,Dune: Part One,10," Excellence at its finest:It's easy to feel fascinated by a movie this monumental. What Denis Villeneuve accomplished, with this masterful work, is something that I would define unbelievably epic, to say the least.The story of Dune takes inspiration from the book of the same name written by Frank Herbert, to start off with something fresh and new.Each actor from this stellar cast does his best to impersonate a well-developed and memorable character. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, in particular, stand out from the rest with their charming and powerful performances.Hans Zimmer really outdid himself, with an immersive soundtrack that proves, once again, that the right choice of music is essential to the overall sensoriale experience.The visual effects are some of the most impressive masterworks of digital art that I have seen in recent years. They are outstanding, incredible, phenomenal: that's because they allow you to immerse yourself deeply inside of the character-driven journey.Ultimately, this movie is an instant classic. We are witnessing the start of a new and exciting saga that is sure to convey a lot of drama and emotion to the public for years to come."
344,Dune: Part One,9, The Best 2021 movie yet:Wooow literally a masterpiece denis villeneuve did a great job and the whole cast did a great job...also it was visually stunning....and the score was perfect for the vibe of the movie...and the CGI was Well done...i am very excited for part 2🤗 I recommend watching it on IMAX.
345,Dune: Part One,9," Lacks a few things but still fantastic in every way:As a person who was a fan of the book series for years, I can say that this movie delivers everything that I had hoped for and more. I saw it on an IMAX screen and believe me, the scale and the visuals were just stunning. Great work by the actors and the cinematography was fantastic. A wonderful adaptation by Villeneuve that lacks some parts I love from the books hence the 9/10 rating but still manages to deliver the feel and the essence of the story. It felt like the way I imagined the story was turned solid and that's the highest praise I can give this film."
346,Dune: Part One,10," Start of a powerful journey:A slow burner, it's not Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but epic in all proportions. Saw it in 3D but it still would have been just as effective in 2D. The story is true to the book, although I read it many many years ago, I think I'll be dusting off the cover and give it a second read. Just a couple of irritations, but quickly forgotten by the overpowering strength of the film. This was only part one, can't wait for the rest."
347,Dune: Part One,10," Wanting more:Where blade runner 2049 felt meandering - and it's best compared to blade runner 2049, both great movies - Dune always felt exciting. The great acting and directing gives the movie a soul of its own.This one is a cinema event. Music and sound effects, the large vistas, the grandiose battles. The special effects adds to the movie, making the fighting seem more desperate than it otherwise would have been. My biggest complaint is that it's made for pg rating. My 2nd (and last as of seeing it once) that the march music is so melancholic."
348,Dune: Part One,9," A Darker Dune:Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10."
349,Dune: Part One,10," Dune part I - Masterpiece:Just finished watching Dune part one. Just As Denis Villeneuve said , that this movie must be watched in IMax on the big screen.When I first heard about Villeneuves new project Dune I didn't know what it was . So I went to the Book store and bought first 3 books about Dune.I can say that I became a fan almost instantly.After realizing how good the 1965 Frank Herbert Dune really is , I hoped for Villeneuves movie to be as good visually and story wise as it was written in the books. And I was not disappointed.Every actor fitted their character. They felt real. Paul Atreides / Lady Jessica / Duke Leto Atreides / Baron Vladimir Harkonnen / Gurney Halleck / Duncan Idaho / Stilgar and Chani. Every actor was casted perfectly.Visually Dune was stunning. CGI was on the highest of levels. The experience of watching 2021 Dune in the cinema is beyond unreal.Still have the Hans Zimmer soundtrack playing in my head. The Theme is perfect. It completely take you and puts you in to the Arrakis where you fight for the survival every second.When the credits started rolling I understood that this movie was just too good to be called just movie.. Its an experience..
Really would have stayed and watched the part II right away)
And at the same time I was so happy that They divided the first book into two parts. That helps not to rush and gives all the necessary details to the audience. So we can understand every aspect of the story.The last thing I wanted to say.. Don't listen to the haters. We all remember what they said about Blade Runner 2049.. Films like this don't just come and go. Dune is here to stay.Go and see it yourself) it's worth it!Now We are waiting Mr Villeneuve for part II !Thank you for the Dune!"
350,Jurassic World: Dominion,," 80% revisiting old characters and scenes  no real story  predictable action...it feels spiritless:This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula.Its always exactly as it has been in every Jurassic film. Big problem all of a sudden, slow moving dino watching someone or breathing around them, then dino gives chase, uff! They barely escaped but escape they did!It is so dull and predicatable.Meanwhile we meet two new types of characters, a) those who are just inherently evil b) those who do evil stuff but are really good and moral. You can tell them apart easily by looking at what theyre wearing and whether its a rich straight white guy.The story is dumb and their evil plan so on the nose it is humorous. Zero imagination when writing the script. The length of it fits on half a napkin.After 80% of the movie is finished and we have gone over the revisiting our ""favourite"" Jurassic characters and our classic Jurassic scenes phase, the predictable ending occurs.And you realize the movie was as a wonderful and full of quality content as a dino fart."
351,Jurassic World: Dominion,3," A generic  lifeless adventure movie that happens to have dinosaurs:If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era."" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/9/2022)"
352,Jurassic World: Dominion,2," Astonishingly bad  long and boring:Bad script, bad acting, stupid story, a new dinosaur every 5 minutes, too long, no suspense, Chris Pratt doing the hand thing, $160 million dollar budget for this, so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took 2 and a half hours to tell me this garbage story.Frankly embarrassing to everyone involved."
353,Jurassic World: Dominion,1," Things I learned from Jurassic World: Dominion...:-Dinousaurs that only survived in warm climates can apparently thrive in cold winter climates-Between the time-span of the last movie several dinousaurs have quickly evolved into partial birds-You can effectively lasso an 8000lb Parasaurolophous on horseback-Velociraptors can get perfect traction running uphill in the snow-Velociraptors will chase you on a motorcycle at 50mph for several miles without tiring or considering going after the many pedestrians on foot along the way-Baryonyx; a dinosaur most paleontologists conclude hunted fish with it's long arms will devour a grown man-The ""Bird Raptor"" dinosaur can swim 50mph underwater and has perfect vision for hunting underwater even though it probably couldn't swim at all-A system put in place specifically to extinguish all of your contained giant locusts only serves to make them escape and continue to live on fire as long as it looks cool for the audience and is convenient to the ""plot""-Mosasaurus a giant predatory aquatic reptile is affectionate towards whales instead of eating them when it serves the ""feel good"" ending-Instead of doing proper fan service to the series, completely abandon the Jurassic Park universe and instead copy Star Wars, The Bourne Identity, Mission Impossible and X-Files then throw dinosaurs in there for good measure!"
354,Jurassic World: Dominion,5," Sorry It Was So Bad:Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie."
355,Jurassic World: Dominion,6," They forgot why we loved Jurassic Park:When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place."
356,Jurassic World: Dominion,5," ""You made a promise.... to a dinosaur?"":Colin Trevorrow was so preoccupied with weather he could squeeze all his ideas into a film, he didn't stop to think if he should try and squeeze them all into his film. The narrative is so overstuffed it would fill a Mosasaurus, the action frustratingly lacks any kind of tension, horror or real threat to the main characters and the occasional call backs seen in JW and JW:FK are now as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. That's not to say its a bad film, there's some excellent character moments with the original cast and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant, injecting some much needed humour into this otherwise pretty dry sequel. Being a huge JP fan, this could simply be a case of high expectations getting the better of me but the lack of exhilaration and awe upon leaving the cinema is painful."
357,Jurassic World: Dominion,3," ""Your screenwriters were so preoccupied with whether they could  they didn't stop to think if they should."":Honestly, I could have adapted any number of great Dr. Malcolm quotes from the other films to title this review, but this one perhaps sums it up best. (Be warned. I have a lot to say, so if you dislike long reviews, skip ahead now.)Here's where I'm coming from:1. Loved Jurassic Park, of course.2. Enjoyed Lost World but disappointed by its missed potential.3. LIKED Jurassic Park III (that's right, I'm the guy).4. Admired Jurassic World for recreating some of the awe of the original with a slight twist.5. Frustrated with Fallen Kingdom's disjointed structure and simplistic characters but its cliffhanger ending left me optimistic for the future.6. Dominion... Well, another Malcolm quote sums it up: ""That is one big pile of s**t.""The Jurassic World trilogy unfortunately has been one of diminishing returns. The first (JW) was a reimaging of the 1993 original (not unlike The Force Awakens was to A New Hope), but with an understanding of modern cynicism and apathy. An early line of dialogue summed up the theme: ""No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore."" Genetically creating a new scarier hybrid dinosaur was an interesting angle, as it kept the scientific focus of the original but provided a meta commentary not just on the JP franchise but on all Hollywood monster movies. While it was no masterpiece, Colin Trevorrow gave a new idea to ponder alongside the dinos, which neither Lost World nor JP III did.Fallen Kingdom was very messy. Since JW resolved its plot quite well, new storylines and characters were created out of thin air, and logic was pretty much thrown out the window. John Hammond had a partner? The island houses an active volcano? Human cloning going back years? Claire now works for PETA for dinosaurs? The last surviving raptor is John McClane? A Freddy Krueger like dinosaur was created that hunts children in their beds for the purpose of...military combat? Yet, for all of Fallen Kingdom's problems, J. A. Bayona at least gave us some new atmosphere and ended on an intriguing note. By releasing the dinosaurs into the mainland, the door was left open for a number of interesting directions to take the final film.What's baffling about Dominion is how it manages, at great effort, to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (pardon the pun). It was supposed to be the franchise's grand denouement. The set up was there--a fastball down the middle --and instead of a homer they hit a long popup to left field while the audience waits with increasing disappointment for the inevitable catch. I didn't care to research what went wrong with Dominion's planning process, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple scripts with different ideas, and Trevorrow (back in the director's chair, and again one of the writers) decided ""let's use them all!...except for the one that examines the logistics of dinosaurs living amongst humans...that one can be trashed.""As other reviewers have discussed, dinosaurs are merely tangential to Dominion's messy plot. For much of the 2 1/2 hour runtime, it's easy to forget about them, since instead the film decides to focus on...the human characters (and locusts?). Aside from the original, the JP movies have had a consistent problem with its human roles, most either being annoying, doing inexplicably stupid things (even the good guys, Nick Van Owen, anyone?), or just being plain boring. It's the last one that hurts Dominion the most.In JW, Owen (Pratt) and Claire (Howard) were stereotypical but capable leads with some humorous interactions. Fallen Kingdom stripped away most of Owen's charisma and gave Claire's personality an unwelcome 180. In Dominion, Owen is now Generic Action Hero, and Claire has made a full transformation from Take-Charge Corporate Executive to a worried mother (over a child who isn't hers) who screams and panics a lot with Dr. Ellie Sattler (Dern) when encountering bugs. So much for women inherit the earth. Maisie (Sermon) also returns from Fallen Kingdom. Sadly, instead of focusing on her grappling with being the first human clone, they've reduced her to an unlikeable angsty teen who serves as a MacGuffin for the others after she's kidnapped by the bad guys for reasons not entirely clear.Bringing back the original cast is pointless if you give them nothing interesting to do. Dr. Grant (Neill) is perhaps the saddest case. In the 20 years since we've last seen him he is still digging up dinosaur fossils and apparently has done nothing else with his life. He has fallen from an intelligent, capable leader to a clueless figure who mostly follows others around looking as confused and bored as the audience. Dern as Dr. Sattler fares the best; she is given the most to do and tries to inject life into the nonsensical plot. Goldblum as Dr. Malcolm is a welcome return, but our favorite nonconformist chaotician would NEVER go work for a genetics lab. Near the film's end he provides an amusing commentary on the movie's absurdity (e.g., his deadpan to Pratt: ""You made a promise to a dinosaur?"")Two more returning roles need mention. One of the more interesting things JW and Fallen Kingdom did was bring back Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong), making him a brilliant but self-indulgent geneticist. Wong sold it very well and it seemed like a natural progression for his character. He felt Hammond never gave him the respect he deserved (like Nedry), so he became determined to make bigger and greater accomplishments (i.e., hybrid monsters) than his former boss, unabashedly and at any cost. It was an interesting heel turn, making Dr. Wu (while never a major role) the most believable human antagonist of the series. Instead of resolving Wu's villainous arc, Dominion inexplicably reverses course and strips him of his hubris. Looking ungodly sick, Wu gives a mea culpa to Maisie for his creation of...giant locusts. No mention of his regret for recklessly creating the hybrid killing machines in the last two movies. Another good set-up from prior movies wasted.And then there's Dr. Dodgson (Scott). JP enthusiasts will remember the character's cameo in the first JP as the competing geneticist who hires Nedry to steal the embryos. And true fans know he played a more prominent role in the second novel. It seemed like an inspired choice to bring back Dodgson, a villain who connects to the plot of the first film and, by proxy, to its three returning heroes. Yet, in his interactions in Dominion with Sattler, Grant, and Malcolm, they never learn of his involvement in JP. Indeed, even Dodgson doesn't seem aware that they were involved in JP, although his character should certainly know that. But for a quick shot of the infamous muddied Barbasol can in his office, you could completely forget who he is. He acts more like an eccentric Steve Jobs with only one foot in reality than the cutthroat scientist he should be. ""We've got Dodgson here!""...yet ""nobody cares."" Nedry was right.If you've read up to this point (congratulations), you'll note I've barely mentioned the dinosaurs. Say what you will about the other movies, but at least they were all about the dinos. Many had distinct personalities that made them terrifying. One of Fallen Kingdom's mistakes was recrafting the sole surviving raptor (the villains of the first JP) as the hero, and raptors are no longer scary. Dominion goes further. Now the raptor (Blue) has reproduced (don't ask) and is a doting mother. There's no menace, and, further, Blue is sidelined for most of the film.Yes, there are dinosaurs, including other types of raptors. Dominion takes Fallen Kingdom's lame concept of laser-guided raptors and embraces it, resulting in a motorcycle/cargo plane chase through Malta that, while visually impressive (and welcome as the first action sequence 45 minutes in), belongs in a Bond or Bourne movie. (Dominion hops across several genres.)Where these never-before-seen dinosaurs came from is unknown. No more than 50 were released in Fallen Kingdom, and these new species were not among them. No explanation...moving on. Some new dinos in Dodgson's ""animal preserve"" (*cough* new park) seem interesting, although we don't know anything about them. To the film's credit, there is a tensely shot sequence involving Claire hiding in a lake from a spine-chilling carnivore. It's the closest Dominion comes to recreating the quiet fear of the original, and it's due to the movie deciding to slow down and take a welcome breath.Though why this lake is liquid when another lake in the same general area and time is frozen over enough to walk on shows a lack of continuity. It feels as though the creative team became entirely overwhelmed with the snowballing plot threads and characters that inconsistencies like this became commonplace. Trevorrow reportedly was pleased Covid delayed the film's release a year because it would allow them more time in post-production, yet with the uneven editing and overall breakneck pace, you wouldn't know it. They had extra time to edit together a cohesive, understandable plot and failed to do so.But Dominion's biggest sin is that it simply isn't scary. Aside from the noted lake sequence, there is no terror, no dread, no sense of dangerous awe. A new apex predator bigger than the T-Rex is supposed to frighten us. It doesn't. When the paths of the JP leads and JW leads finally merge while cornered by the big dinos, they act like they're in peril, but we don't buy it. We don't believe any of these stars will die (they don't), and we're not invested enough in them to care anyway. The characters lack agency, and it's boring. Dominion mostly swaps quiet scenes of terror of humans using their wits to face off against dinos (e.g., JP's T-Rex escape, raptors in the kitchen) for interchangeable dinos fighting each other in yawn-inducing brawls.During one of these, Dr. Grant notes aloud: ""This isn't about us."" How true, and how sad. Dominion fails to exert dominion over itself."
358,Jurassic World: Dominion,2," Absolute trash:This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of ""real"" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it. Oh well. Just Hollywood doing what they do best."
359,Jurassic World: Dominion,4," Wayne Knight said it best three decades ago: We got Dodgson here  and nobody cares.:I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.This didn't happen.No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper."
360,Jurassic World: Dominion,2," A Bad 3:00 AM B-Movie Dressed in a Big Budget:I'm going to make this short...Jurassic World: Dominion is like cleaning out your refrigerator and dumping a bunch of stuff in the trash. Only in this case, they decided to dump the ""stuff"" on the screen in this film. Jurassic World: Dominion has a lot of story arcs with no real connection or depth. People are popping in, popping back out, then popping in again, boring us with trite laughable dialogue and no real character development; you don't really care about any of these people. Just when you think there might be something to a scene with the familar charcaters, CUT TO another scene with no set-up. This film is like watching a 3:00 AM B-movie that is so bad, it does its job by putting you back to sleep. And let's talk about the dinosaurs, velociraptors and various man-eating prehistoric creatures...nah, it's not worth it because other than the penultimate scene where the biggest and baddest were going at each other, they were simply an after-thought. Go figure.Everyone connected to this film tried to do too much and it didn't work as far as the storytelling is concerned. As I said before, they emptied the refrigerator and threw in everything in this film and it left a bad taste in my mouth because there was just too much ""stuff."""
361,Jurassic World: Dominion,6," Is anyone else tired of Chris Pratt and that damned hand?:It's just amazing that no dinosaur hasn't bitten it off yet. In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here. ""Alan Grant....... Ellie Sattler"", I actually liked the new characters. DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones - they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed. The special effects are, as expected, first class although really? A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names). Not sure that it's worth the Hollywood Blvd/Times Sq ticket prices ($20+) , but it's an okay way to spend a summer afternoon. I think tho, I'd wait til next weekend when the crowds will be 65% less."
362,Jurassic World: Dominion,1," Jurassic World Dominion:Easily my least favorite movie in the Jurassic Park saga. Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself ""Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM"". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money."
363,Jurassic World: Dominion,3," As Ian once said  ""that's one big pile of s#*%"".:I loved the first Jurassic Park (1993) film and still think it's an amazingly enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%""."
364,Jurassic World: Dominion,3," As generic as Hollywood 'blockbusters' come. And I've seen a lot of 'em.:Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a self-parody during the first act of the movie. Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon."
365,Jurassic World: Dominion,1," No respect for popcuture and cineastic art - please  let the modern Hollywood go extinct:Colin Trevorrow has managed to make himself the Ryan Johnson of the Jurassic Park franchise with this film and the vanity with which he promoted and defended it. Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for ""rescue"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of ""Dogson!"". We've got Dodgson here"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the ""heroes"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic."
366,Jurassic World: Dominion,1," Insufferable:I absolutely hated this film... legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers, a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable. The actors aren't at fault, the visuals are good (as you might expect from a movie this expensive), but the script is atrocious, and ""the epic conclusion"" is not very much a conclusion, the main issue is not solved, and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film, absolutely terrible film, don't watch it."
367,Jurassic World: Dominion,6," Too long  some neat set-pieces:I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.6/10."
368,Jurassic World: Dominion,4, See the Original:This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies. The original was excellent and fun. This was an excuse to have a reunion. The movie can't stand on its own. I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies. He didn't get it. I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds. Not even camp enough to be fun.
369,Jurassic World: Dominion,3," Avoid Like the Plague:Life once found a way. Now, I hope it loses itself.Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.All throughout this movie, the word ""Dumb"" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one. This was just crap.***Final Thoughts: Easy listing of the Series. Hint: Only watch the 1st three listed below.1. Jurassic Park2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park3. Jurassic World97. Jurassic World Dominion98. Jurassic Park III99. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom."
370,Jurassic World: Dominion,3," The biggest disappointment of 2022!:Wow, foiled again, a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up, it has a great cast, with some familiar faces, a big budget, so there's action galore, and some wonderful music, but a plot..... a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studio.How on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous, so empty, this film made me feel nothing, other than boredom. £40 that could have been used on so many other things.It's not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals, there needs to be some sort of plot, but there just isn't one, in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs, but of course you know what's going to happen. Some of the visuals are great, epic, some scenes though....did they run out of time?Chris Pratt, didn't do it for me, the old cast tried, but it felt hollow.Like the dinosaurs themselves, this franchise should have been left in the past. 3/10."
371,Jurassic World: Dominion,2," Wow  that movie was about as dumb as they come!:The new Jurassic World movie has got to be one of the worst big budget hollywood film I have seen in quite a while. The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here. As a conclusion to this trilogy, it fails in a majority of areas. Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive. I would recommend waiting for streaming, it wasn't even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale. 1/2 a dino out of 5."
372,Jurassic World: Dominion,2," Are we serious?!:Truly a shameful film made in a hurry and without a plot that is linear or otherwise makes sense. Since Jurassic World in 2015 the Jurassic saga has gone to die, with dinosaurs that were better made in 1993 and with characters that try to retrace the steps of the main protagonists of Jurassic Park but fail to even be iconic for the film itself. Somebody has to stop them, they are ruining a saga that was never supposed to be revived again, it was over in 2001 and I still ask myself now, ""but was it really needed?"" I sincerely hope that this is the last chapter, although I'm afraid not, because really how can you put locusts as the villain of the movie... ARE WE KIDDING? I would have expected anything, but locusts don't. Then there are some characters in particular Henry Wu who in the previous 2 chapters was the villain who created monsters and here instead he wants to save everyone but for no good reason, they don't explain why Wu became good from one moment to the next and this angers people no end. Let's not talk about how they evolved Maisie Lockwood's character because I really found her ridiculous. One of the worst movies of this year, someone needs to stop this CRAZY."
373,Jurassic World: Dominion,7," Get the hat!:4 yrs have passed since the events of Fallen Kingdom. Dinosaurs now roam the modern world and people have somewhat adjusted to that fact. For the most part, the apex predators have been rounded up and kept contained by special organizations. However, there has been quite the demand in the black market for dinosaurs of all kinds. Illegal breeding sites are everywhere.One of the organizations that prioritized rounding up the apex predator dinosaurs is Biosyn, a global leader in most every industry, from biological science, to engineering, to improving food crops. Biosyn has set up a sanctuary research facility (in the middle nowhere) where they house most every species of dinosaur on earth. There they study dinosaur dna in hopes of finding uses for all kinds of human diseases and deficiencies.Throughout the heartland of the U. S., an anomaly has begun to occur. Something has begun destroying crops everywhere,, with the exception of very specific crops (or shall I say,, specific crop producers). It has the scientific world baffled, and worried that if this continues the entire world's food supply
will disappear within a generation.One scientist in particular concerned with this anomaly is Ellie Settler, who is en route to visit the Biosyn research center and get some answers on what they are doing to combat these problems. Her only problem is needing someone that she trusts to back her up. So who can she call on but her old flame and partner in the game of science Alan Grant!Owen and Claire have retreated to Owen's cabin in hopes of keeping Maisie hidden from the world, knowing that certain people would do anything to get to her, study her, etc. Now 14 yrs old, Maisie is very much at odds with how she came to be in the world, and wonders who her mother (Christine Lockwood) really was. She's also very tired of being kept hidden from the world, and has a habit of wondering away from their homestead.Also,, Blue has set up a nest not too far from the cabin,, and has given birth,,,I don't want to say much more,, I will say
that I think the negative reviews are not completely deserved. Is the movie a groundbreaking, perfect example of a film? Well, no. Neither were the last two! Imo, it's fun, and I didn't see the direction they went in coming (at least not most of it). It's a straight 7 rating imo. I will also say that this needs to be the last (but we know how that goes)."
374,Jurassic World: Dominion,7," I had a good time:Was it perfect? No. Was it fun? Absolutely! There will be a lot of things people will pick apart this movie for. I for one didn't mind it. It was a solid closing chapter to the Jurassic World trilogy. It was a nice balance with the newer stars and the OGs. A lot of ""hey, I know you from such and such"". When the casts get combined I was so happy. I love my OG Jurassic Park crew. They were my main reason for being excited and I wasn't disappointed in that regard. A lot of fun sequences really helped keep me entertained. It could've been a bit shorter but I'm still happy with what I got from it. Go in to have fun. It won't do you any good going in expecting a masterpiece. Plus it has a ton of baby dinosaurs, they were sooooo cute!"
375,V for Vendetta,8," ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."":Placed in futuristic Britain, this movie tells a story about dictatorship and the man who became symbol of it's downfall. People from many, not to say majority, countries in today's world can easily identify with the characters. Great adaptation of DC comic and always gladly seen Natalie Portman.8/10"
376,V for Vendetta,10," My Personal Favourite Movie of All Time:It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.It blew me away in many ways, and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media, and it helped me immensely in establishing my more left-leaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film, but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design, to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes (in comparison to other action films of its ilk), opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development, surprised me the first time I watched it, but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium (both of which have massive third act spectacles) the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films (ironic, since Equilibrium is about emotion). While short, the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V, the titular anarchist vigilante, Evey, the young woman who is kidnapped, and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast, and there's Detective Finch, a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V, and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time, and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive, and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.There is something to be said, however, about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic, but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work, and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script, maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel, and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film, and that is a very well deserved critique of the film. I do not claim that V for Vendetta is the best film ever made. I haven't even scraped the surface of world cinema and cinema history to ever make that claim. However I can definitely say that V for Vendetta is, at least for the time being, the most personally meaningful movie, and the most enjoyable movie, I have ever seen. Mad Max Fury Road did get close though."
377,V for Vendetta,10," A Bloody Masterpiece!:I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.10/10"
378,V for Vendetta,9," Terrifying and inspirational:This is a very unique film. Watching it again 15 years later, it's amazing how much closer we are to this totalitarian future. A must see."
379,V for Vendetta,9," Among the best stuff you'll see from DC Comics.:DC Comics has a rather poor reputation lately. Despite having some great superheroes, the films based on their characters often have sucked. However, one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way, if you like this film, try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very, very similar themes and both are wonderful movies."
380,V for Vendetta,10," More relevant than ever:Here we are, 2021, almost 2022Do I even need to explain why this movie is of the most importance?Watch itUnderstand itKnow how a fascist state is born, nurtured, and risesAnd now look aroundYes, you may thank me later, if it is still allowed by then."
381,V for Vendetta,7," ""remember the Fifth of November  gunpowder  treason and plot"":While the Visuals look dated, the Vibe is Very current. The parallels in this Version of reality is ominously similar to our own 2020. Viral disease, politicising Vaccines, at least this pulls the Veil on what a true fascist totalitarian regime is like along with government control media."
382,V for Vendetta,," Utterly Spectacular!:I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.10/10"
383,V for Vendetta,," V:Some of the action might be a bit choppy, but V for Vendetta is extremely entertaining. Its great visual effects and Hugo Weaving's iconic portrayal of ""V"" is more than enough to satisfy even the strictest of viewers. There is also a great message about rising up against political propaganda within its great style and environment. Another great film from the Wachowski's is now on your hands."
384,V for Vendetta,10," Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!:'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up."
385,V for Vendetta,10, If you are a movie buff 'V for Vendetta' is for you:Honestly I am speechless after watching this masterpiece. Hugo Weaving is a genius who played such a difficult role with such a perfection. Full marks to Natalie Portman. A great movie which will keep you indulging. A must watch.
386,V for Vendetta,10," Ideas Are Bulletproof and One Man Can Make the Difference:In a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November, 5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument and starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive secret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of the investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the truth about his leaders while chasing V.""V for Vendetta"" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year. The story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist attacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times as a lesson of freedom and citizenship. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""V de Vingança"" (""V for Vendetta"")"
387,V for Vendetta,10," This is one of the best films I have ever seen...:...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you."
388,V for Vendetta,9," a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time:V for Vendetta rating: 3.5 out of 4V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit, this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution, meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the near-future paired with an operatic comic book tale of love, mystery, and a Guy-Fawkes-masked rebellion. Our hero is V (Hugo Weaving), a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive, a taste for the eloquent, and a hand for knife-wielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice (or maybe hostage) is Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen (kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world) as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler (John Hurt), whose persona is shown primarily through a five-story tall projection of his ever-angry head. The exposition for this near-future lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middle-eastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra ""England Prevails!"" Rest assured, however, this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps; it's a world that's, instead, very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment, refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic, after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. On the eve of November 5th, when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth, V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network, he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution, with the evolution of Evey's politics, the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot, and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. ""Remember, remember the fifth of November."" What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler, the news media is heavily clouded, our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks; not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of today--where the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of Communism--V for Vendetta's answer to that question is a sure-handed yes. But V for Vendetta is no heavy-handed political allegory. At its heart, V for Vendetta is entertainment. And as any entertainment with a hand in Victorian elegance, V for Vendetta must have romance. But before you conjure images of the Fawkes mask flying in a sweaty bald-headed scene of lust, realize first that there also is a master-grasshopper dynamic between Evey and V. The romance is formed as an understatement and rarely addressed, let to simmer below the surface and lend more chemistry to scenes that would otherwise ring hollow.Natalie Portman may have stolen the tabloid exposure with her shiny shaved head, but Hugo Weaving is the masked performance that steals the show. Much of the role's success lies in the writing, for V is made not to be simply a mask. There's a theme throughout the film asking whether behind masks of revolution, there lie fighting men and women, or only their ideals. V answers this question with charisma. Contradicting the common mantra that masked figures must be laconic, V, in fact, probably has the most lines of all. The character is full and rich with quirks and personality, but still exists with that essential air of mystery. Weaving achieves the same level of iconic performance that he did with Agent Smith in The Matrix. It really is that good.There's been debate over the quality of adaptation the Wachowski Brothers offered to Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Moore has publicly separated himself from the film, quoting in the New York Times last week that ""the screenplay's rubbish."" Well, before we all walk away from the ticket line, remember primly that Alan Moore will be the first to tell you himself that he is a selfish, pretentious prick. He knows it, and we know it. Let's move on. The screenplay's fine. In fact, it's a near-masterpiece. What the Wachowski Brothers have done is find the right balance between the theatrics of the graphic novel, and the solemnity to the richly Victorian narrative. They form a dynamic that plays to both sides, allowing for a story that sparks both political debate and giddy entertainment. We'll first shake our heads at the sentimental, soft-focus flashbacks and silly sub-plot for ""nuclear human experimentation""; but when mulled over, we realize it's just the comic book mentality showing its spots. After all, V wouldn't start all his sentences with v-words had this film shunned its comic roots. And anyway, V for Vendetta is a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time."
389,V for Vendetta,9, Very pertinent for our times.:I feel every person on the world should watch this movie. It's very time important. And is a real reflection of what's going on as of right now. On top of that. It's a fun ride with great acting and a fantastic cast. If you watch this movie. You should realize the goal of all politicians. Absolute control and rule thru whatever means necessary. All governments should be de-centralized And this movie shows what happens when people let the government run rough shot.
390,V for Vendetta,10," Still epic and quite relevant to today's troubles:Still brilliant 16 years later after as many watches.This never gets tired and every time I watch it I see something new..
if you haven't seen it, get it watched..
If you have... watch it again..
easily in my top 5 best movies ever in my opinion
Sometimes I get frustrated with the tripe that gets released these days, but when I do, I go back cinematic gold like this."
391,V for Vendetta,9," Anonymous wants you:V for Vendetta is an allegory. It is rather apparent the Wachowski Brothers wanted to make a critique of George W Bush's post 9/11 USA.The vehicle they used was Alan Moore's graphic novel with the setting a futuristic and fascist Britain.The film that inspired Anonymous. We have a masked anarchist voiced by Hugo Weaving exacting revenge on John Hurt's High Chancellor whilst trying to save Natalie Portman from the secret police. She later becomes an ally.V for Vendetta deals with issues relating to a repressive state. Totalitarianism, homophobia, Islamophobia and terrorism. The film with its controversial themes has attracted both criticism and praise, although author of the graphic novel Alan Moore is unhappy with the adaptation.The acting from the cast is excellent. Portman, Weaving, Rea, Hurt and especially Roger Allam all excel.It's a brave and a cutting edge film packed with entertainment values and also thought inspiring. A real must see."
392,V for Vendetta,10," Remember  remember  V for Vendetta  the writing  character and plot  i know of no reason why this movie should ever be forgot!:First, I have to give credit and praise the team behind this film, for releasing a movie so politicly powerful and sharing a strong message how ""we"", as ""we"" the people living in our country shouldn't be afraid of our governments 4/5 years after 9/11 and during the massive political protests in many countries around the world.It is sad to think that 15 years later in this rough, chaotic 2020, when I saw this movie for the first time, I realized that my countries government isn't far away of being like the government presented as a villain in a fictional, sci-fi, DC made film based on a graphic novel. Hope that in the future things will change for the better, but we should not stand low and keep on fighting.The movies writing and characters have so much emotion, care and love put into them. The plot and the story are powerful, heartwarming yet entertaining. Action is well filmed and exciting. And the acting is just, WoW! Hugo Weaving kills it as V, and Natalie Portman's character Evie's growth through the story from beginning to end was so well done that id had me tearing up!In my opinion, a MUST WATCH! Honestly my favorite DC movie ( yes, love it more than the Dark Knight ) and one of my top 5 favorite movies.A perfect 10/10 from me."
393,V for Vendetta,8," Riveting and Exciting.:This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by""V."" Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives. Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you."
394,V for Vendetta,10," One of Those Rare Films to Really Earn a 10:In the future, England is controlled by a fascist, 1984-esque government. One man, who calls himself V, has taken on the guise of Guy Fawkes and has made it his personal mission to destroy Parliament and get England to rise up. He befriends Evey (Natalie Portman), who sometimes sees his side and sometimes doesn't.I've given out a handful of 10s. I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done, I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim, you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful, but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell"", even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes, the alliteration. I love the anti-government, pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that, this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance, not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action, fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times, especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking, but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman, like good dramas and action films, and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see. Already firmly planted on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250, I have no doubt it will stay there for a great many years."
395,V for Vendetta,10," An amazing feat of Cinema:""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."" I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow."
396,V for Vendetta,8, A Blueprint or Warning a for 2020?:Watching this in 2020 is eerily identical to current events. Perhaps this was a blueprint or a warning?A great film but a little bit too close to home.
397,V for Vendetta,8," An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom.:It's a little weird watching a dystopian movie like V for Vendetta (2005) in 2020. I watched this film each year around the 5th of November, but life eventually got in the way and made it difficult to continue the tradition. At the time, I enjoyed the ""underdog"" of V (Hugo Weaving) protecting art and freedom of thought from the tyranny of an oppressive government. Having gone back and re-watched it in the current global climate, I'm honestly shocked at how prescient it was in predicting a lot of our future. Hopefully, things don't become worse to the point of completely fulfilling this prophecy.I think part of the reason this film remains timeless-other than the flawless performances of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving-is how it shows the amount of freedom people in society give up in the name of ""safety."" Fear-mongering is a common political tactic to get individuals to vote for a particular party. All we have to do to be ""protected"" is to allow those in power to do what's in ""our best interests."" Except, rarely are the actions of leaders in the best interest of their constituents. After all, absolute power corrupts absolutely.Fortunately, V for Vendetta provides a glimmer of explosive hope. Where tyranny is exposed, the one force that can stand up to it is the Populus's combined force. No political system is perfect, but the will of the people-if unified-can overcome great oppression. People die; ideas live forever. Now, whether or not our current global situation can garner enough unity to shatter this broken system without resorting to V's explosive measures is an exercise left up to the reader.An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom, I give V for Vendetta 4.0 stars out of 5."
398,V for Vendetta,10," Frighteningly prophetic and blisteringly relevant:It's remarkable how this film came to us before Brexit, before Trump and before the pandemic. Granted, it was borne out of disillusionment and rage over Bush and Blair's corrupt handling of domestic and foreign affairs back in the day and post-9/11 (hence the themes of Islamophobia). But with time the film has only become more topical than it was in 2006, when I was asleep and didn't even know of its existence. More than a decade later, I have finally now seen it and I am left wondering what lessons we as a people still have yet to learn about our governments and their descent into totalitarianism. There's no telling if it has predicted even more of our future. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone."
399,V for Vendetta,10," REMEMBER  REMEMBER  THE 5TH OF NOVEMBER!!:Brilliant film that ive watched every November from the time I saw it in the cinema. Incredibly well made and adapted that centres around V who is determined to finish Guy Fawkes plan and brings Evey in on his plan to take down key government members and destroy parliament for all sorts of crimes brought against society that lead to thousands of deaths. Some of the themes seem quite relevent to the current world now which is quite scary. Hugo Weaving was amazing as V, Natalie Portman as Evey also and the great cast makes this film for me a shoe in top 100 film all time."
400,Avengers: Endgame,7," Not as good as infinity war..:But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them"
401,Avengers: Endgame,8," Not as good as infinity war but a great movie:Rating: 8.6Not as good as Infinity war pacing-wise, but is a satisfying ending to the saga. High production quality, and a great soundtrack like its predecessor. The final fight did feel a little cliché (two armies brainlessly charging at each other for a typical smackdown). Not much to write about, it made every marvel movie before it worth the ticket."
402,Avengers: Endgame,7, These get worse!!!:I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.
403,Avengers: Endgame,10," Crazy in every sense:This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."
404,Avengers: Endgame,10," Perfect ending:After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending."
405,Avengers: Endgame,10," The End of an Era!:After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
406,Avengers: Endgame,," Half this movie is boring  emotional dialogue  unlike the first part all action!:I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.Several other points of disappointment, too.Bummer."

409,Avengers: Endgame,10," The ending made all 22 movies worth it:If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
410,Avengers: Endgame,6," slighty awkward or boring at times  slow dialog  some cool stuff:Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story."

Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!"
412,Avengers: Endgame,7," Oh. My. Gosh! What a boring movie!:The alternate title for this film: ""How to Cram a 90 Minute Movie Into 3 Hours."""
413,Avengers: Endgame,4," The writers got carried away  the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.:I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it."
414,Avengers: Endgame,," Meh:Not a full review cause I don't feel like doing one.Endgame was fine. It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel cliché you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023."

417,Avengers: Endgame,8," A little bit underwhelmed:Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me."
418,Avengers: Endgame,10," J:It was perfect i had so much fun while watching the movie it's been 3 hours but we didn't feel, every one in the cinema cried and laughed, and I liked how when tony stark is dead there wasn't a drama and his wife when she tells him (everything will be okay) and the sceine after tony stark died when he said ""i love 3000""

420,Avengers: Endgame,10, Overrated.:The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time. (Will Always be the Most Overrated and most Forgettable Movie Of all Time.)
421,Avengers: Endgame,7," Emotional but bit messy.:So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good."
422,Avengers: Endgame,9," Very disappointing:Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out."
423,Avengers: Endgame,7," Pure torture:I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
424,Avengers: Endgame,4," Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories:Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back."
425,Prey,7," If it bleeds...:Confession: I'm the guy who watched the original Predator way too many times thanks to the magic of VHS...but then never watched a single sequel afterwards. As far as I'm concerned ""Predator"" = jungles and body butter. So I fully admit that I have limited context here. That said, this movie kicked butt. I cared way more about Naru and her brother (not to mention her dog) than I did about anybody in the original. I found the cinematagrophy breathtaking, I found the characters compelling, and I'm kind of all in on seeing what happens when we transport modern franchises into different historical/cultural contexts. Plus, the callbacks were delightful. Nobody's going to give this movie an Oscar, but I'd rather watch a story like this than most movies with capes and poorly staged action sequences. I was sucked in from moment one, and Amber Midthunder completely captivated me for the whole runtime. It's nice to know that movies like this can still surprise me, not to mention make me stand up and cheer."
426,Prey,," Review Of 'Prey':I didn't hate this movie but I thought the writing was very sloppy, considering the fantastic premise offered so much potential. Sorry if I start to ramble, but it really bugs me when I believe a film could have been greatly improved with a few tweaks of the script. So my problems are as follows (please hear me out - and excuse such a terribly long review, but I just can't help myself, lol):Why is Naru 150% convinced right from the first tiny hint at the predator that there's this HUUGE threat out there? As far as she knows, the predator hasn't hurt anyone except for a snake, and when Naru finds a weird footprint and sees the unnatural, purple lightning/light flashes just before she falls when the mountain lion attacks - how are those things indicative of a bigger threat than the metal trap her dog gets caught in at the beginning? And why does she even think the mysterious purple flashes and the footprint come from a creature of flesh and blood? The only thing she could possibly conceive of (remember: this is a Native American Girl from 300 years ago) is some forest spirit or even some kind of God that has come to these woods - certainly not a creature that any normal Native American would ever intend to hunt (on the contrary, such a creature would more likely be respected or even worshiped).What I'm trying to say is: the predator at this point hasn't done anything that would require any action from Naru (or anyone else), and it's only the audience who knows from previous movies that this creature is a threat - there's no way our heroine would logically deduct that from the evidence she has. The trap her dog got caught in at the beginning on the other hand IS a sign for a huge threat to the tribe, but she doesn't even think it's necessary to warn her people about it, let alone further investigate who/what put it there. I think the script does the character of Naru a huge disservice by making her look rather over-ambitious to prove herself instead of actually giving her a plausible reason for wanting to protect her village by going after the predator.If on the other hand the script had made the stakes more personal (and more primal), it would have worked to the character's and the story's advantage in my opinion. For example: imagine a scenario where they went after the lion, and her brother defeated it - then out of nowhere comes this monster and kills her brother and Naru's the only one who saw it and nobody believes her - then she'd have a believable motivation to go after it. But strange lights and a footprint? Really? That doesn't seem in line with anything we know about Native Americans from that period - it's just the script that insists this makes sense.And Naru's actions towards the bear are another good example of the writing not doing a very good job at showing her as either a skilled hunter or someone who ""only wants to protect her people from a threat"". Naru is portrayed as this child of nature that knows every plant and every animal track, so when she hears a bear, we must assume she knows it's a bear - yet she goes straight towards it. Why? The bear's not a threat towards anyone, and we learn it's peacefully eating its meal - a scene that shouldn't come as a surprise to a Naru in any way.But she observes it as if she were witnessing something exceptional or new to her. And does she quickly retreat when the bear gets her scent? No, she tries to shoot at it with a bow and arrow! Why would she do that? Is that the action of an intelligent hunter or someone who wants to protect her people? And when that (literally) backfires and gives her position away, and she only gets saved by the dog distracting the bear, she even runs after this gigantic grizzly and tries again to shoot at it with her bow and arrow (and don't tell me she tries to save her dog, because that dog is perfectly able to outrun the bear, as is made very obvious in that scene). The script makes her behave in a way no Native American ever would, and I think the writers should have tried a little harder to portray that culture in a more realistic (and thus more respectful) way.Because here again Naru comes mainly across as someone who's over-eager to prove herself in a one-on-one combat with a dangerous adversary. Her actions seem inept and reckless, and the script makes that even worse since the young men sent out by Naru's brother to rescue her all get killed.And here comes another thing that irked me: all the young Native Americans except for Naru's brother are shown as these angry, violent brutes who even beat Naru up. I'm not an expert on Native American cultures but this did strike me as kinda extreme, and it also bothered me in terms of the storytelling. Naru's brother obviously loves her and cares deeply about her, and the other young men who respect him and followed his order to ""rescue"" her must know that. Would they really behave in such a brutal, violent way towards the beloved sister of the guy who sent them to rescue her?And I think all these issues could have easily been fixed: If Naru's brother had been killed by the predator after the lion hunt, and If the other young men in her tribe had thought he had been killed by either another lion or a bear and decided to hunt that beast refusing to take the girl along whose story about the ""monster"" they didn't believe, our heroine would have had a more sympathetic reason to go after that hunting party: both to save them AND to avenge her brother by killing the monster. Instead, the script almost makes it look like she's partly responsible HER rescue party gets killed, because she blindly follows her ambition.Another huge issue: what's up with the Frenchies? They discover a helpless Native American girl in a trap and decide: she MUST KNOW something; she has to help us catch the Predator - err... why? Mr Alien Trophy hunter has only just arrived, and we've seen him work his way up from snake, to wolf, to bear, to Native American - but the French haven't even met him yet (if anything, they only caught a glimpse, plus the dude's invisible), so why are they now all so hell-bent on catching it? Even if they had found the body parts of the other Native Americans - why would they care, let alone deduct what that thing's intention was or conclude that they should drop all their activities to catch it with the help of our heroine?The Frenchies hunt for fur which they can sell - where's the profit in investing all your energy in this predator hunt? Did I miss something here? Absolutely none of their actions or their behavior make sense. If on the other hand the script had set up a scene where we learn that the whole French party had come under attack by the Predator, and it's now a question of survival for them to learn how to defeat it, then their actions would become understandable. But there is no such scene.Another example for the sloppy writing: The plant that lowers the body temperature to such a degree that the predator literally doesn't see those who have eaten it (and the effect already works mere seconds after the plant has been ingested) is an incredibly dumb plot device. I can believe an alien trophy hunter coming to earth, but I have a hard time suspending my disbelief to the point where this ""magic"" plant exists that can drop your temperature from 36 degrees Celsius to as low as your surroundings (if I'm not mistaken there's even snow flakes falling during the end fight, so it must be pretty cold - but you'd be in a coma already if your body temperature dropped to only 30 degrees Celsius). Also, how quickly the heroine realizes it's the plant that's responsible for the predator not seeing the wounded translator guy is just plain laughable.Another huge shortcoming of the script is that the protagonist has zero character arc: Naru remains exactly the same stubborn, ambitious person that thinks she's better than all the others from the beginning of the film until the last frame, without even so much as a hint of any inner-growth. At the end, when she gets celebrated by her people (because surprise, surprise: she DID prove herself), she relishes that moment. She sees a little girl that looks at her with admiring eyes and is proud to be a role model for the next generation of female warriors/hunters. Yet after all she went through - is that really how she should feel? I mean, after she decided to go Predator hunting - and the script fails to give her a credible reason other than that she's desperate to prove herself to her people - a whole rescue party led by her brother went after her, and all of those young men - including her brother - suffer horrible deaths.Yet nothing in Naru's final moment of triumph reflects that terrible loss. If anything, I would have expected our heroine to realize that this was a very sad victory, and that her moment of triumph wasn't really one to celebrate, since seemingly most of the young men in her tribe have perished. This was another wasted opportunity by the writers in my opinion: if they had shown Naru distraught at the end when she gets celebrated by the whole village; if we had seen her with an empty stare at the moment she achieved her goal to prove her worth, they could have given her character more depth (and at least a little bit of an arch).Overall, it's still a watchable movie, I just wish the script had tried to explore Native American culture in a realistic way and dared to bring something original to the table. The fantastic premise lends itself for more than just a YA action adventure with some added gore, because the predator and the Native Americans reflect each other in interesting ways: both highly value the art of hunting a worthy adversary; even the collection of trophies from defeated foes (scalps for the humans - skulls for the predator) is very similar. This could have been an intelligent thrill-ride exploring those parallels, but unfortunately they opted for bland action instead."
427,Prey,8," Prey is a back to basics return to form with tremendous atmosphere and suspense that unfortunately won't be experienced in theater.:As a lifelong fan of this franchise I am admittedly biased. Since the revolutionary classic first film, Fox/hollywood have made 4 sequels all of which I have thoroughly enjoyed/ still critiqued. A perfect sequel hasn't been made imo and may never be, but I can say this new film has the closest effective wilderness ambience/suspense to the first film and that warrants great praise.I was skeptical with a few things judging by the trailer but seeing the final product I can say that no matter the logic holes in the mismatch of Pred vs prey , the film is executed quite well. The settings are phenomenal and amplify the overall product. Dan Trachtenberg has a keen eye for detail as seen in 10 cloverfield lane and shows it once again. The costume design captures a completely different timeframe awesomely as well as shows a new more prehistoric predator that might be the coolest visually yet. Music and sound is crisp and powerful and adds so much. The acting is bare bones but for the story it has to be as far as context.It's a shame that this had to be only streaming as it should have been in theater. The scenery is fantastic. But regardless it's a surprising return to roots as far as the back to basics setting and suspense aspects. It's another welcome sequel and should be seen by any predator fan or action fan."
428,Prey,8," A worthy prequel to the classic:I think Prey did an excellent job at crafting a fresh new story. Let's face it, predictor sequels and spin-offs have felt more like a money grab. But here there's a real story that cleverly weaves a number of story lines together to spin up this intriguing edition.Amber Midthunder more than holds her own and keeps the pace moving. And the movie does a great job at leveraging the historical context for maximum effect.Big thumbs up from me."
429,Prey,8," Who's the Prey and who's the Predator??:I was only going to rate this until I decided to read some of the comments. This was easily the best one since the original. Not even close to me. I was hopefully when Shane Black did a ""reboot"" in 2018 I believe. I was disappointed. This was taking the franchise back to the basics and that was a good think! If you liked what Rogue One meant to Star Wars then this story will connect with you. I loved the cinematography. It was beautiful. The acting was really good. Don't worry that the lead actors aren't more well known. I was really not expecting much to be honest. The sequels since The Predator have been let downs. I only watched because the trailer had me with taking it so far back in time. At an hour and forty min it wasn't too short or too long. It was the perfect run time. I hope that you like Prey as much as me and that you rate and leave a comment. Happy hunting!"
430,Prey,5," Just so-so (one spoiler):People really need to think when they write a screenplay. What could have been a great movie, perhaps as good as 1 and 2, rather than the pablum that followed, is just a foot note in predator history. The cast was ok, but the story fit the plot, not the other way around. The girl was a great tracker, ever yet fell right into a mud puddle. Why didn't the trap break her ankle? The movie was slow, too. Until the middle when it sped up. If I never watch this again, and, unlike 1 and 2 which I have and do watch I won't be sad. The unbelievable part was a 7 foot tall predator going toe to toe with a 5 foot tall woman. I know, empowerment, but believability on this was zero.Here's my big spoiler: THE DOG LIVES!!!"
431,Prey,3," A pile of old predator poo.:1719, The Northern Great Plains: Comanche girl Naru (Amber Midthunder) is desperate to prove her worth as a hunter; when a predator comes to Earth, she gets her wish.In 1987, the galaxy's ugliest alien hunter met Native American soldier Billy, played by 6' 2½"" Sonny Landham, and killed him with ease. In Prey, a predator does battle with more Native Americans, but meets his match in teenager Naru, all 5' 5¼"" of her. Welcome to 2022.While not quite as atrocious as The Predator (2018), Disney's latest attempt at rebooting the Predator franchise suffers from the preposterous notion that a girl armed with sticks and stones can defeat a member of an advanced race that has dedicated itself to the thrill of the hunt. In one scene in this debacle, the predator kills a grizzly bear (just one of several unconvincing CGI animals) with its bare hands, throwing the dead animal through the air - and yet a girl with a tomahawk is able to bring down the alien in the predictable finalé. I'm all for positive female role models in film, but this is ridiculous*.The film also fails by making its alien virtually indestructible (at least until it comes face to face with Naru): the creature is stabbed, speared and shot point blank in the head, yet still comes back for more. In this film, if it bleeds, it's still bloody difficult to kill.As a plus point, the film looks amazing (digital animals aside), but nice cinematography alone doesn't make for a good Predator movie.*To those who mention Aliens, Ripley doesn't actually fist-fight a Xenomorph, at least not without the help of a power loader.3/10. I watched the original Arnie movie today to remind myself how it should be done - a stone-cold classic!"
432,Prey,5," Please don't believe the hype:Its a good movie, HOWEVER when you've had a string of losses in the franchise, mediocrity can appear to be a masterpiece.First off, why does everyone speak perfect English? Its 1700 stop.Second, how does an untrained hunter become skilled in CQC. I get she practiced but disarming and killing rough men like a special forces operative?Third, you're telling me a flower lowers your body temp to invisible on infrared?Fourth, why does the brother just give up when they could have teamed up? Seems like everyone was just set up to die but the MC, hell even the dog didn't even get a scratch.Fifth, whats up with the tree kicking?Sixth, you master interstellar travel, you have active camo, laser guided bombs, laser sights, but no laser gun? Guess it being the 1700s that predator hasn't ""upgraded"" yet...Seventh, A predator can knock out a bear in one punch but somehow stuggles with humans...Eighth, why is the plot armor so thick to ensure she never takes a real hit from man, or beast, or Predator. When it had her by the throat... game over for everyone else but the MCNinth, how the hell is the MC faster than a deer and a predator?Tenth, How does someone fall into a mud pit and NOT retreat to the solid ground they were literally standing on a second ago, one foot behind them.Eleventh, If you create a new weapon, even a simple one, would it not take time to learn to use it? The MC is basically unstoppable and unbeatable, never do they feel in danger because you know they'll win.The hype train is gonna go long and strong with this one. People will ignore all the glaring issues, lack of character, lack of emotion, lack of anything remotely riveting. The stripped back feel is nice but they forgot to add something beyond women are better and stronger and faster then dumb old men."
433,Prey,8," Prey marks a return to form for the Predator franchise with a unique take on the material and solid lead in Midthunder.:Set in 1719 in The Great Northern Plains, Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who while trained as a healer has aspirations of being a hunter like her brother Taabe (Dakota Beavers). When Naru sees what she thinks is the ""thunderbird"" in the sky, she takes this as a sign she is ready to prove herself a hunter. As she joins a group lead by her brother set on taking down a mountain lion, they soon come across a creature more dangerous than they've encountered before.Prey marks the first Predator movie made and released since Disney bought Fox and the first entry in the series since the underperformance of 2018's The Predator. The film began development under the working title of Skulls when director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriter Patrick Aison approached series producer John Davis with the initial concept that would become Prey. Trachtenberg hasn't directed a feature film his breakout hit in 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane with a number of projects he's been attached to either moving on without him or getting cancelled with Trachtenberg's largely being on TV. Prey marks both a welcome return for Trachtenberg as well as the Predator franchise as it's probably the best entry we've had since the first one.Much like prior films Predator and Predator 2 which took established film staples such as commando and cop movies and turned them on their head with the inclusion of an alien trophy hunter, Prey takes a set of characters in its Comanche natives who could've easily sustained their own movie independent of The Predator and make for an engaging mashup with the established monster much as they did with the characters in the first and second films. Amber Midthunder is our lead Naru and she's really good in the film as she's capable in the fight scenes but also is very green which helps sell the rougher edge to the fight scenes which include some of the clumsiness you'd expect from such skirmishes. The other actors are solid performers and lend themselves to some entertaining and very brutal sequences in the film, including a sequence in the third act which had a nice nod to the ending of Predator 2. The Predator design is really unique featuring a cruder version of the helmet that more resembles a skull than the one we're used to and it works in context. We also get a solid dog character in Sarii who's pretty much a co-lead in the film and they're every bit the character you'd expect from a human actor.Prey is solid genre fare in its own right, but it also brings the Predator series back on track after getting derailed with the mess of 2018's The Predator. Amber Midthunder is a great lead as Naru and the action and spectacle delivers. The third act runs a bit long and maybe could've been streamlined, but aside from that this is great enetertainment."
434,Prey,8," Definitely worth your time!!:Had to start a 30-day trial on Hulu just to watch it but It was pretty boss, so I'm not mad. The story was basic and took us back to the roots of the Predator franchise with its pre-America setting.Like the new predator deign but far more impressed by how the new predator moved and reacted. Whoever they got in the costume was really doing some acting, making himself look like the baddest hunter on the block. It does not stand out any better than any of the other Predator movies in my book but as far as being the first one by 20th Century Studios done under the Disney Banner it was violent and gory enough for my taste.Worth possibly getting Hulu for."
435,Prey,3," Could Have Been Great Had They Kept It Realistic:There are a lot of reviews here defending this film, calling it the ""Second best Predator film!"" in the franchise, and throwing around a lot of buzzwords for anyone who doesn't like the film. There are also an incalculable amount of individuals defending the main character, Naru, saying she relied on her wits and tactics to win fights, and that's what makes her believable. That's only partially true.See, Naru literally has the strength of three men (if you watch the film you'll know what I mean). Can survive physical traumas no other character in the Predator franchise was able to survive, and can move as fast as a small sedan. She does use some tactics, but most of all her feats are of the physical variety, and literally in the realm of being a super human the likes of which would make Captain America jealous.Without spoiling anything, it's simply that Naru survives things she shouldn't survive, and can do things multiple times outside her weight class to the point where the suspension of disbelief is not only shattered but grounded into dust and scattered among the four corners of the wind. For everyone who defends Naru as a character, just ask them some simple questions: how did she recover so quickly? How did she manage to out-power men? And why was she able to survive things nothing else in the film could survive?The responses will be a smattering of equivocation and justifications that don't hold up under scrutiny, and that's where this film's biggest problem comes in: it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.Another big problem is that no one seems to be properly afraid of the Predator, even during an era where superstitions were mightily high. Naru shows no fear of anything, even in many life-threatening situations, which seems completely opposite of someone her age. I'm sure someone will justify why, but I would instead point out that this just pulls you out of the film as being nonsensical and unrealistic. Why does this teenage girl have a deathwish and fears nothing? Constantly trying to engage in situations where things are purposely trying to kill her?A good counterbalance to Naru is the daughter from Shawn Linden's film Hunter Hunter. I didn't like the second half of that film but the first half was brilliant. Why? Because it was grounded, realistic, and intriguing. Also, it was completely believable that the daughter was that good a hunter; we saw how she trained with her father, in a realistic manner. We saw that even with all her training since a small child, she was still prone to mistakes, and how the fight/flight/freeze mechanism came into play when her wits and abilities were put to the test. That's how you pull the audience in and keep them rooting for the character; when they're grounded in realism.The problem here is that Prey is rife with anachronisms from the modern era. How Naru behaves, how she talks back to everyone, and even how she's depicted in never being afraid of anything (although, to that end, almost no one in the film seems to properly show a realistic kind of fear given their circumstances).The anachronisms combined with the super-human abilities just takes away from the film, and that's a real shame because if this film was grounded in realism, it actually WOULD be the second best Predator film. Why? Because it's filmed quite well; Trachtenberg knows his way around a lens, and he makes Canada actually look like a pristine northern forest from 18th century North America. Lots of fantastic wide-angle shots and great color composition help give the film a nice, authentic look. Sound design is absolutely on-point, and the score isn't over-done or too nostalgic.Unfortunately, the film is plagued by too many problems. They should have committed to having the Comanche speaking Comanche throughout the film (as this would have brought the film to another level of quality and authenticity, much like Mel Gibson's Apocalyptico), they should not have had modern-day behaviors that seem mirrored after social media expectations of characterizations, and they should have given Naru realistic feats appropriate for her age, height, and weight, as that would have done wonders.For me, I was willing to give this film a shot, but the more I watched, and the more I thought about it after watching, the lower the score became. It's essentially a good film marred by its own undoing. A lead character who is depicted as always being right (even the film manages to retroactively throw that in as it progresses), and having her depicted as having super-human abilities, while outmatched and out-manned, just took me completely out of the film. Also in the original Predator, Arnold's character Dutch did ZERO damage to the Predator in their hand-to-hand fight, and Dutch was at the brink of death in just a few hits from his over-sized foe. And none of Dutch's traps worked against the Predator save for a contingency trap that he used after another trap failed. Keep that in mind when watching the final showdown in Prey."
436,Prey,5," This is as far as girl power goes...:No more. This is it...i wish.I liked the period piece approach. Interesting. I was with the movie upto 10 mins prior to film end. I even bought the whole she's a ninja and can manhandle a group of armed wildmen barehanded. I even swallowed the whole, eat a magical flower that instantly matches your internal body temperature to your ambient climate....
However, I draw the line where a 100lb Neolithic spice girl does what a 220lb bodybuilding special forces trained late 20th century weapons guy never could... get into it with a savage advanced hunting alien in a bare knuckle brawl on who's the biggest and baddest swinging ck.. this side of the galaxy.At some point, these spice girl, girl-power themes in movie should work to inspire the possible, instead of making movies that take the impossible to extremes..."
437,Prey,2," Predator Never Knew What Hit Him!:Damn! Watching this movie i learned 1 thing, Arnie could learn a lot from this teenage girl! She could run circles around this old war veteran who lost his whole team of war veterans and had his ass kicked by the challenge-chasing-hunt-hungry-tech-savvy oversized alien! This little girl got all jacked up in just few days, she did something big old Arnie did in years and years of hard training and fighting! Put a string on a tomahawk and all your skills reach 100 in no time! And i get it, she could not be bothered trying to save her tribe members cause she had a thing to prove - That she could hunt! It doesn't matter if she had any other motive other than to prove a point! Also, can you really be called a tracker if you have a dog sniffing around? No no no, i won't go there! I told myself i would watch the new movies and just turn off my logic! Hollywood did that years ago so i should just adapt."
438,Prey,2," Too much plot armor and too modern:There's a bad trend in current Hollywood entertainment to making period piece movies as modern as possible. They would have fans believe that people in earlier centuries talk like modern day Gen Z young adults. PREY is the latest in a line of movies that do this. The characters talked like they were on some CW teen drama! There's also a modern trend in female-centric action movies where the female protagonist is the only capable one among a sea of useless, beta males. Yet it was all the ""useless"" guys who kept saving her life in this movie! Especially her brother, who kept coming through in the clutch to make sure she survived. In the first half of the movie, she didn't seem very athletic or sporty. She looked weak, ran slow and wasn't very agile. She struggled against one of her own male tribe members who looked almost as physically slight as her. Speaking of, she performed a lot of physical stuff that didn't mesh with her small stature. That scene of her pulling herself out of the quicksand didn't look very believable. She didn't look remotely strong enough to do that. She got physically thrown to the ground a few times including hitting her head hard at least twice yet survived and even with surviving how did she not get a serious concussion and was able to function immediately after? And throughout the movie, she kept tossing her makeshift rope axe deep into tree barks and yanking it back and forth when she looked like she had all the strength of a little kid.Then after the halfway mark and AFTER her leg was injured in a bear trap, all of a sudden, she was miraculously faster and stronger than when she was uninjured, including taking out 5 much bigger guys. She got somewhat of a jump on a couple of them with a blade and I had a hard time believing she had the physical strength to wound them as she did, and the rest of them just waited their turn instead of just jumping her all at once. Also, the scene looked incredibly staged with the characters moving like they were doing an action ballet and her knowing exactly when and where to grab the blunt instruments at the perfect time to take out her attackers. And this is the only scene until the climactic battle with the alien where she seemed capable, almost like the writers needed to shove in a couple of scenes of her being badass so viewers could scream and cheer, like she actually did herself in the end. Yet none of it felt earned due to shoddy, manipulative writing. Outside of her 2 big fight scenes, she seemed pretty weak, lost, scared, and aimless. How was she so clumsy fighting someone almost as puny as her, but so agile and strong against multiple big guys and the Predator himself? Where were all of her fast reflexes and advanced fight moves early on? How come she was barely holding her own against ONE weak tribe member almost as puny as her if she could do all of this? How did she have the strength and force to be able to throw around and kick guys twice her size multiple feet? Where was all this speed and agility outside of her 2 big fights?Throughout the bulk of the film, she kept getting saved by EVERYONE: her brother, her fellow tribe members, those French-Canadian hunters who captured her, the Predator, and even by her dog, who must have saved her like 3 or 4 different times! The dog kept showing up at the most opportune times to distract whoever she was fighting so she could escape. If she was so capable, why wasn't she showing all of these abilities before? How is this manifesting at the perfect time to take on the Predator? Where's the actual development? She just could do anything the plot required her to do when the time came. And when she was inept, someone or something else would always either purposefully or inadvertently show up to save her. Like why did the lion immediately maul her beta male tribe member, yet hesitate to attack her? Why did the multi-lingual French guy not just shoot her after she killed his friends? Why did the Predator constantly ignore her when he saw she was a hunter like everyone else? I don't see how a character with the ultimate plot armor is one that I should be rooting for. Speaking of, she was also a very unlikable protagonist, more on this later. And the dog had a ton of plot armor, too. Then in the end, she beat the Predator (of course she did) again being miraculously sporty and strong doing things she couldn't physically do most of the time. How did she have any slack to move her head and body while the Predator was holding her neck into the ground? And finally, how was she in all her 100-lb glory able to DRAG the mammoth alien into the mud swamp? If anything, she's the one who should have been pulled in the opposite direction as soon as she yanked that rope, not the other way around.Now to her character's personality. Even outside of all the fake fight scenes, though, one thing that I need a character to be for me to root for them is well-written and acted, and neither this character nor the actress fit the bill. Her line delivery was incredibly bland and her ""acting"" consisted of making constant bug-eyed expressions. And most of her dialogue consisted of modern-sounding snark and sarcasm. And she was always short with other characters sighing and eye-rolling. It was like watching Max from Stranger Things! Lol Also, the CGI was pretty noticeable throughout most of this movie, especially the animals. And did I forget something from the original Predator in the 80s? Even when he took his helmet off, he could still see Dutch in front of him without it. Basically, sans helmet, he should still see stuff, but it's just that he didn't have his targeting device on his helmet. So in this movie, why was he unable to see without his helmet? When his helmet comes off in front of the dog at the French camp, he still should see the dog right there. It was only like a few feet in front of him. He should still see AND hear the brother was circling him doing all that screaming. He should still see the girl in the climactic scene. But it was like he was completely helpless without the helmet. Yet the '87 version could still see without it and always knew where Dutch was in their final fight. Is this a retroactive new rule made up to give the girl in this movie an extra advantage? Speaking of, why did the Predator have ""ancient"" laser bullets and helmet yet everything else the same as in '87. This is an advanced alien race with spaceships and ability to cloak, yet they couldn't create lasers until much later as if they are just like humans? The entire movie seemed to be about leveling the playing field making the Predator look vulnerable and dumb just to accommodate the primitive time period. She constantly got saved by all the male characters, her dog, and even the main antagonist then in the end she is shown to be smarter, better, and stronger than all of them including nerfing the Predator so that she would be able to defeat it. And it was utterly predictable from the very first frame of the movie. A ""canon"" story is something that feels logical and cohesive with the original and I don't believe Prey is canon. For me, there's only one Predator film from 1987 and none of these other sequels, prequels, whatever, are canon."
439,Prey,4," Honest review: good setting but the rest is flawed and sloppy and doesn't do the greatest hunter in the galaxy justice..:4* out of 10*I seem to be one of the few having issues with this film and I am truly surprised by all the positive reactions, professional reviews and praise it gets. I would rank this #5 in the series (after the OG, P2, Predators and - yes - AvP).What I do like is the setting, putting the Predator in pre-civil-war America and having it go against the Natives is a fun idea! The Predator design with the bone mask and some of its weapons are also well-done. Some spectacular visuals and set-pieces and good tension in various scenes.Naru however is quite obnoxious and her only motivation is that the wants to be a hunter. The Predator didn't even attack her or her tribe, so there was really no reason to go after it. She ends up getting the whole rescue party AND her brother killed. If she is such a good tracker, why would she walk into a mud puddle / quick sand in her own front-yard? Why would she attack the bear for god's sake - WITH AN ARROW? Also, this woman is not a good actress, she only has this one slightly annoyed and defiant facial expression.They should have had them speak Commanche with subtitles the whole way. Hearing them switch from their native language to the weirdest thick American accents was so off-putting. I mean, they had the French speak French. Would have made the film more authentic and shown more respect for the tribe's people.The CGI (in particular the animals) is pretty awful.Why would the Predator kill a rabbit, a wolf and a snake? It is known to NOT hunt the weaker - which is shown when it ignores Naru several times because she is no threat. This was completely AGAINST ITS CODE OF CONDUCT.In the finale, the Predator makes an arse of itself by getting beaten in a fist-fight by a 50 kg girl and then SHOOTING ITSELF IN THE HEAD. (How did that even go down? I really did not understand. And how on earth would Naru know how the technology works and how to use it to her advantage?). Predator kills a 500 kg bear with its bare hands and presses it overhead easily but still it can't touch her in the final fight (and I don't care if it was injured before, this is supposed to be the greatest hunter in the universe! It felt truly disrespectful towards the character of the Predator). Remember Billy, the 2m-150-kg-of-muscle native American with the huuuuge knife from the orginal movie? Well, the Predator made quick work of him.... It's great to put Predator against a strong female, they just should have had her beat it more using her wits and truly out-smarting it and not by running around and slicing it in such a stupid and completely unbelievable manner.The French are portrayed as absolutely soulless, filthy, stereotypical morons. Why would they even go after the Predator and not try to save their furs and their lives?The absolute worst and most cringy scene: Cramming in the brother having him say ""IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!"". Although the Predator HAS NOT BLED ONCE UP TO THIS POINT. Let alone that the brother would have seen it.The more I think about this film, the more flaws I find and the less I like it.Biggest missed opportunity: They failed to have the Predator self-destruct in the end!!"
440,Prey,4," Boring and Pointless:Probably the most ""serious"" film in the Predator series but might as well be the most boring one, except for the AVP abominations (if you consider them as part of the franchise). Even the awful ""The Predator"" has more to offer on terms of plot and excitement. I appreciate the filmmakers took the movie seriously and didn't make it the silly movie that is ""The Predators"" but that doesn't make this one good either. Sorry, I don't understand why people like it so much. I found it pretty dull and pointless. Also, the references to Predator 1 and 2 were pretty heavy handed."
441,Prey,2," This was really awful:Advanced alien vs primitives and you expected a fair fight?! The first half of the movie was totally pointless. What's an alien doing killing animals? What's he doing fighting a bear?! There was no suspense whatsoever. The fights were laughable. Plot was non-existent, cgi was below standard, and it was way longer than need be. And talk about the worst climax in any Predator series. I mean this is suppose to the the advent of Predator but man they could have at least come up with a better antagonist. This was just another ok movie not worthy of a second watch. So thoroughly disappointed."
442,Prey,1," A 100% political agenda movie about an untrained girl that can beat an unstoppable predator:So, a predator who is almost unstoppable and can kill a bear with his bare hands can somehow not kill a small girl and not see his own laser?.Let's not forget this guy is part of an advanced race bend on hunting other lifeforms.The movie is beyond idiotic. I didn't know that it was made by Disney, now it all makes sense.In 2022, a small girl can be better than any other male over the face of the planet, no matter the training.This movie deserves a 1 for the political agenda alone.Also, the CGI is WORSE than the original Predator movie."
443,Prey,8," great Predator film:It's 1719 on the American plains. Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who wants to be a great hunter. Her brother Taabe is a natural born leader. The world of the white people is slowly intruding on their world. A strange thunder cloud announces a different unwelcomed extraterrestrial visitor. It's the Predator.I love two thirds of this movie. I love Naru slowly uncovering the Predator's presence. I love this native American world and everybody's performances. It is better than anything since the newness of the original. I do have an issue with the final battle. The more daring ending would be an epic death. I never got the sense that she could prevail over the Predator. I prefer the non Hollywood happy ending. Nevertheless, this is still a great Predator film."
444,Prey,3," another ""I'm a big big girl  in a big big world"" movie:What is this and why? I know it's a scifi, but can we please make an effort to make things believable?I'm pissed I have to swear I don't mind female heroins. I love Alita battle angel, Alien, Mad Max, resident evil, all of them with female leads, but for God's sake what is this?Unless you're a teenage girl, give this one a pass. I'm only giving it 3 stars for the cinematography."
445,Prey,8," Everyone Knows How It Will End  And Yet It Was Very Entertaining:Plot: easy and the end is totally predictable, still the development and getting through this fight of predators to see how the hunt is done, it was very entertaining. The end is a little bit forced, maybe you can pass on it.Actress & Actors and Acting: nothing to say against the cast. They all did their job well. The main character's actress did very good, in my opinion, I liked her.Visual Effects: well the movie is darker than usual, so it's not that you'll see all the details, but, for me, the story took over it. In my opinion, in late 2022 it's quite a shame this kind of behaviour as I guess that nowadays should be easy doing visual effects.Conclusion: a good movie to pass some time. Personally I would recommend it to everyone who likes pure action with some tense moments. But if you know nothing about Predator, probably some part will be something like ""What? Why?""."
446,Prey,4," Another misfire for this series:The 'Predator' films are so consistently disappointing. Every time they get our hopes up, and every time when we finally see the movie they are shattered. I suspect the series doesn't know what it is anymore. They certainly don't feel like horror movies.I couldn't think of a more boring time and setting for this movie. The Comanche people portrayed in the film have only one thing to live for - survival. So a Predator coming to pick them off isn't exactly upping the stakes for them. It is also makes it very hard for them to be personable and likable. Every character in the film other than the main girl might as well have been the exact same person.The problem with the Predator in these films has become that it is simply too powerful. It never feels like there is a fighting chance for anyone. So it's just waiting to see which style it uses to kill each person. It becomes extremely boring quickly.I just couldn't find much to like about this film. I was bored for the entire 99 minutes. It's not scary, it's not interesting and it isn't intense. 4/10."
447,Prey,1," I ""Prey"" this is the last one.:I was actually rooting for the Predator in this one. It's a horrible movie. Not even believable on the science fantasy genre. Poor directing, writing and lighting. Oh and the CGI bear looked like 1980's graphics. They had better special effects in the 1987 Predator."
448,Prey,10," Watch the Comanche Dub version:The Comanche dub version changes some of the subtitled dialogue compared with the English audio. The English audio dialog was too colloquial; it sounded too contemporary and literal, as if it could've been spoken in 2022 instead of 1719. The Comanche dub also pulls you into the movie more, and it improves the acting performances and the aesthetic of the film. It gives off a sort of an Apocalypto vibe. Bad or good accents have a big effect on a film. (Think Harrison Ford as a Russian submarine captain in K-19 The Widowmaker with his unapologetic American accent). I enjoyed Prey considerably more in Comanche dub than English audio.One criticism I wanted to address: I've read some early reviews/comments about ""Comancheria"", that the Comanche were horse riding peoples occupying the flatlands of Texas/New Mexico/Oklahoma, aka ""Comancheria"", not on foot in mountainous woodlands. They seem to think the setting was supposed to be Appalachia (it was filmed in Alberta, Canada) and therefore it isn't historically accurate. Obviously this is a bad take because this takes place in the Northern Great Plains in 1719, probably in northeastern Wyoming, which is entirely historically accurate and consistent with the range of Comanche in the early 1700's. And they did not all have horses in 1719, especially in the north at that time, horses were much more scarce than they were in the lower Great Plains. Anyway, six minutes into the film it tells you specifically that this is in the Northern Great Plains in 1719. These critics seem to know everything they know about the Comanche exclusively from John Wayne films.There are many other bad takes I've read such as the typical boring ""Mary Sue"" complaints. These critics don't recognize that this is essentially a David and Goliath story. David didn't defeat Goliath with brawn, but with his ingenuity, which is how Naru defeats the Predator. By the way, that's also how Arnold defeated the original Predator; his strength wasn't enough to win, he had to rig some elaborate traps. And in the end the Predators actually killed themselves in both films.The last bad take I want to address that I keep hearing about is that the Predator has a ""code of honor"" and Prey breaks that code several times. These critics are referencing a so-called canon in comics and books but not any of the movies, because none of the movies portray any code of honor. First of all, comics and books are irrelevant; any future writer or director can ignore them; it only matters what's on film. The Predator is a trophy hunter and a thrill seeker. There is no honor in hunting game for trophies, just like there is no honor in humans hunting lions or tigers or bears or elephants for trophies with rifles from 500 meters while dressed in camouflage and hiding from a stealth position. If the Predator had honor, it wouldn't use stealth armor. That's why Taabe shouts, ""Cheater!"" when the Predator turns on its stealth armor during their battle (in the dub version). In the original Predator, it discarded its stealth armor only because it malfunctioned. It then fought Arnold hand to hand after sizing him up because he found Arnold to be worthy of a fight; but that wasn't a code of honor, that was just adrenaline and anger; it was ticked off. And when it lost the fight, it decided to nuke them both- very dishonorable! The Predator in Prey fights a bear but the bear loses track of it because of the stealth armor. I don't find that to be honorable. It fought the bear because the bear was worthy of a fight like a bull is worthy of a matador. Lastly, to highlight the fact that the Predator has no code of honor, Prey features French trappers that trap and skin animals. Skinning buffalo for their furs is not honorable, just as Predator killing animals for their skulls is not honorable. But when Naru says a prayer for one of the buffalo spirits, that was a display of honor that we never see with Predator. That scene firmly establishes that the Predators do not have a code of honor."
449,Prey,8, Bravo:This and exactly this is what I have been asking for from a Predator movie. Healthy mix of guerrilla warfare and alien tech. I am also glad to see how predator tech and Armor isn't as evolved as the one in the OG movie. That balanced out the whole weaponry and it is still a lot of creative and practical.Sound design requires special mention as it is one of the best I've heard in recent times. I hope it gets many nominations. Watch it in Atmos theatres if you can.VFX of some creatures (not the predator) was shabby. Editting in some places felt choppy but nothing that would take you out of emersion.Acting of all the leads and support was great. Specially the character of Naru and her brother had nice chemistry. It's not the most heartwarming brother sister written but for the runtime they made sure it's not half baked.The characters of French felt one dimensional and shoehorned. I wish they movie was a little longer and they explored the predator's arrival on the tribe.Director of photography has done fantastic job to capture the native landscape and action scenes were well shot.Overall it was fantastic movie and is among top 5 alien and predator movies.
450,Back to the Future,10," So good in so many ways:I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
451,Back to the Future,10," How could anything be more fun than this?:Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."
452,Back to the Future,," A Time -Travelling Classic:Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics."
453,Back to the Future,10," Great movie:One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films."
454,Back to the Future,10," A classic masterpiece the original the only best my favorite time travel film of all time:What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """
455,Back to the Future,9," Gets Better With Age:A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all."
456,Back to the Future,," Gotta get back in time! Get back Marty!:BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic."
457,Back to the Future,10," An '80s classic that never disappoints:I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason."
458,Back to the Future,," Time Travel Movies Are Always Brilliant:Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.Anyone who watches this movie will love it."
459,Back to the Future,10," Absolute Classic:As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!"
460,Back to the Future,10," Part 1-Goodness gracious! Great balls of fire!:I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10"
461,Back to the Future,9," Let your imagination fly:A funny sci-fi? Unusual but here it not only works but does so spectacularly. A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles you leaving you wanting more.The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.Fun for the entire family."
462,Back to the Future,10," The Lost Blockbuster:Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.  Well worth your time."
463,Back to the Future,10," 1.21 giga watts of awesomeness:This is without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. Back to the future stars': Micheal.J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Crispin lover just to name a few. I did that without checking ether which proves that I've seen this movie WAY to many times in a week (6 times to be exact). Lets get to the plot.It's about a kid who gets sent to the past, accidentally stop his parents falling in love and seducing his mum? Creepy.Real talk time!!!! (A time when I talk about whats good/bad about a movie) The Cajigger: (main plot item) it is the DeLorian the coolest time vehicle ever made. 88/100The feel: this move irradiates 80s' it has the cool guitarist, it has the girls with weird hair, it has the teen which just wants to rock 'n' roll... PARTY ON.The Doc: he is the equivalent of mixing Dr Frankenstein, Mel Brooks and Dr Evil. You get the idea. A funny, crazy scientist. It's as epic as it sounds.This movie is easily the best time travel movie and even the best movie ever made.don't do yourself a disservice and not watch it. GO WATCH IT."
464,Back to the Future,," Typical 1980s Film That Still Delivers:""Back to the Future"" is a very smart film that benefits from likeable characters and an insightful screenplay.  Michael J. Fox accidently goes back to 1955 in a DeLorean that has been turned into a time machine by the wacky Christopher Lloyd.  Now Fox must bring his parents together after he inadvertently changes the future.  It is not quite as complicated as it sounds.  The film is great fun that seems brand new 15 years later.  A great movie by Robert Zemeckis.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
465,Back to the Future,," adorable:all seems great. the idea, the script, the acting, the details who define each period. and the flavor of ""50's in the most realistic manner to define it. sure, it is the result of a happy meeting between a courageous and real great director and the best actors for its project around a dream who is preserved by the imagination of each from us. but not the idea is the most important thing. the mixture of humor, tension, cultural references, the chemistry - yes, the word sounds strange but in this case is the best - between Christopher Lloyd and Michael Fox , the wise use of clichés about teenagers and family, the ignored guy who becomes hero, all make the story to roll in amazing manner. so, a sort of masterpiece. and one of the most adorable meet with a film. off course, a legendary one."
466,Back to the Future,," You gotta come back with me...:Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th time of watching and never fails to bring a smile.  Humour for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those young at heart?From Marty's ""Johnny B Goode"" to Doc's classic ""Run For It Marty!"" You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart."
467,Back to the Future,9," Great Scott! Back to the Future is a great time-travel movie!:Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the ""Johnny B. Goode"" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love"". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads."
468,Back to the Future,10," Best Part of a the Best Movie Ever:When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."
469,Back to the Future,10," As close as you can get to a perfect movie:I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see."
470,Back to the Future,9," Proof that Hollywood once was capable of putting magic on film:I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."
471,Back to the Future,9," Pure Genius:Time travel is a difficult subject to cover in a movie, but Spielberg pulled if off with the Back to the Future trilogy.Michael J Fox in his finest role as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd as Doctor Emmett Brown make an unlikely pair, then again a DeLorean makes an unlikely time machine, so i guess it doesn't matter.OK so there are some plot holes (Marty the youngest Mcfly, dissapearing from the photo last) for example, but the overall impact of the film is so entertaining that bigger plot holes could have been allowed and the film would have been just as good. It's hard say why this movie is so great, or why it still looks as good as it does, even by modern standards (don't forget this is 20 years old) but if it has escaped your viewing then just see it as soon as possible and i'll bet you'll want to see the rest of the trilogy the second you finish watching it.I think it's just entertainment in its purist form.A big 9/10"
472,Back to the Future,10," A film you can watch time and time again.:My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs..."
473,Back to the Future,10," My All Time Favorite Movie!:When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it."
474,Back to the Future,10," Both Humorous and Entertaining:PlotMarty's good friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, invents a time machine in the form of a sports car and because of unforeseen circumstances Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 where he ends up meeting his parents and inadvertently fowls up how his parents come together and fall in love. This blunder endangers Marty's very existence because if his parents don't become an item he will never be born so Marty must move heaven and earth to get his parents on a road to romantic bliss. Meanwhile the younger version of Dr. Emmett Brown must find a way to get his time machine working so he can get Marty back to his own time.Character DevelopmentThe lead character Marty McFly doesn't experience much character development, but he is able to influence others dramatically. Only these developments aren't the focus of the story and mostly happen off screenActingOne of the ingredients that are equal to the magic of the story itself is the acting. The characters come to life on screen and carry over to everyday life. This has become an event film that has worked its way from pop culture to film history that has helped mark a decade. There is nothing second rate when it comes to the acting for there are no false moments in any of the cast's performances. Though there is a lot of action and racing about, much of what makes repeated viewing of this film possible are the humorous situations that Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) keep getting themselves into and how they react to them. All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.OverviewThere are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesn't connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the cast's older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around."
475,Inception,10," A one-of-a-kind mind-blowing masterpiece!:My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:
Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular ""Nolan's spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.
SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called ""inception"". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream"", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.
Some short lines about the cast:
Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie."
476,Inception,10," Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is?:You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this."
477,Inception,10," Inception was only less shocking to me than the Matrix:When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter."
478,Inception,10," Didn't win Best Picture? WHAT?:Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon..."
479,Inception,10," Insanely Brilliant ! Nolan has outdone himself !!:What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards."
480,Inception,10," In a Decade  ""Inception"" May Be A Religion:Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater."
481,Inception,10," My number one favorite movie:Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!"
482,Inception,10," Generation defining.:The 20th Century had Casablanca, Star Wars, the Godfather, Blade Runner, and others - this is the first of the 21st Century masterpieces. Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale. Remarkable and breathtaking."
483,Inception,8," Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.:This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many."
484,Inception,8," Wait:Wait, did i just watch this or is it just a dream?"
485,Inception,8," Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.:I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"
486,Inception,9," Matrix but in dreamworld? Nah.:I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!"
487,Inception,10," Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!:I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
488,Inception,10," Nolan at his most intelligent best.:Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."
489,Inception,9," This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.:Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10"
490,Inception,10," The perfect summer blockbuster?:What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!"
491,Inception,10," Come Back Again!:If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie."
492,Inception,9," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture  till date:Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
493,Inception,10," Sweet Dreams:I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn't know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they're incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it's a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it's such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don't want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don't think there isn't one person I wouldn't recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the ""Zero Gravity"" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I've seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10"

Brilliant screenplay and I think no need to talk about acting, cinematography, editing and others because this is a Nolan movie."
495,Inception,6," Dream invasion is the focus of a strange and ambiguous film...:I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun."
496,Inception,10," Inception; Christopher Nolan's masterpiece?:Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent."
497,Inception,8," Am I dreaming:Though this was a very good, on your toes, don't blink kind of movie. In the end, I had to ask myself, ""Was it all a dream?"". Acting superb and directing on point. Very good movie."
498,Inception,5," Good idea lost in the noise:The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)"
499,Inception,10," Nolan's first true masterpiece:Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
500,The Hunger Games,8," I'm shocked! I loved it!:First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn't see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it's fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancé and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn't know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I'm surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager's intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn't afraid to tell you the truth.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the ""tributes"" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker's son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the ""tributes"" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don't mind when there's not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn't tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn't 3D because I would've had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don't feel for them as much.But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it's released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I'm looking forward to the sequels and most of all I'm just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we're dying to see what happens to our hero's next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It's one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it's a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she's ticked off the rich.8/10"
501,The Hunger Games,3," How can this be a cult movie?:OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the ""let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike"" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the ""citizens"" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow ""is this really it?"" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few ""ups"" for me among the many ""downs"" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a ""sugar-monster"" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying ""only hope is stronger than fear"", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset..."
502,The Hunger Games,8," Silent Thrills:The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling."
503,The Hunger Games,3," Everybody cheer the state sponsored child murders!:Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! In ""The Hunger Games"", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. The huge success of ""The Hunger Games"" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next ""Twilight"" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least ""Battle Royale"" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in ""The Hunger Games"" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.I was in fact, highly excited to see ""The Hunger Games"". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, ""The Hunger Games"" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.3/10"
504,The Hunger Games,6," Well  it's no Battle Royale...:There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be."
505,The Hunger Games,7," Not quite the Battle Royale:Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better."
506,The Hunger Games,1," Spoilers! But don't worry  it's already predictable and weak.:The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. ""Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!"" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll."
507,The Hunger Games,3," Battle Royale with cheese:In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank."
508,The Hunger Games,3," Poor Adaptation:What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film, please allow me to describe what I love about the books.Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty, these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary, yet wholly embraced- even celebrated- by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes, they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same, some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses, it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However, these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given, and violence a sad but expected part of life.The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death- heart-wrenching in the book- is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books, I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all, including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry! I cannot believe the filmmakers overlooked this important point. The Capitol's exploitation of the Districts is supposed to be the backdrop for the entire story. When Katniss arrives in the Capitol and observes how food appears at a touch of a button, she cannot understand how Capitol residents fill their time. The majority of her days are consumed with feeding her family. It defines her. Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games.The beginning of the movie seemed promising. The ominous mood in District 12 was just right. It is apparent that the people who live there are exhausted and resigned to their fate. When residents appear for the reaping, they look like cattle being rounded up for slaughter. The Capitol, in contrast, is frightening in it's frenetic artificiality. This juxtaposition was well-done. However, the filmmakers lost me when the tributes entered the arena.There was no sense of tension. The tributes make all kinds of noise as they move through the woods, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being hunted. Katniss stands about ten feet away from Cato as he snaps a boys neck and we are supposed to believe he doesn't see her? The scenes from the control room are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They should have spent that time on character development! Unfortunately, this lack of character development causes the emotional scenes to fall flat. I am astounded this was even possible, given the subject matter, but the overall result lacks intensity and depth.I will credit Elizabeth Banks with an excellent portrayal of Effie Trinket. She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life. Donald Sutherland also does well as President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence is an adequate Katniss but Josh Hutcherson is terrible as Peeta. He's just not very likable. We see none of his inner strength. Instead, he comes across and whiny and weak. And Wes Bentley seems to be included just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard.One more thing. What happened to Haymitch?! He's supposed to be a self-destructive drunk! His cunning is all the more unexpected because he seems incapable of taking care of himself. I was thrilled when they cast Woody Harrelson and he does well in some parts but it seemed like they had to water down his character to market it to young adults.This movie had a lot of potential but it fell short in many important ways. A score of 3/10 is pretty harsh but I felt as though the filmmakers kept all of the plot points and none of the meaning. Read the books instead."
509,The Hunger Games,8," action:A grand historical picture rolls out slowly, war, slavery, resistance, has already had an epic meaning."
510,The Hunger Games,1," derivative and boring:I've never read the books but went to an afternoon screening to see what the fuss was about. ""The Hunger Games"" I felt was a complete bore. The story unwinds in an excruciatingly slow manner and you really have no emotional connection with the characters. The plot-line itself---people of a dystopian future being made to fight to the death on TV has been done to death (no pun) and done with more wit an imagination in ""The Running Man"" for instance. The gladiator story is told much better in real gladiator movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Spartacus"" which are both hugely better than ""The Hunger Games"".For an action movie it feels like days go by before there is any real action. The ""name"" actors like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland seem to be as bored as the viewer is with this material. The unknown actors playing the competitors are wooden. When there is action it is usually with such herky-jerky camera work that you can barely follow what is happening. And there are some gaping plot holes. SPOILER ALERT the heroine is treed by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down. And of course they snooze instead. The ""simulated"" monster animals that can actually devour people? Most of the competitors are killed off camera? Come on. . ."
511,The Hunger Games,7," Nice adaption from the book  but...:One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book."
512,The Hunger Games,3," One of the many failures on the blockbuster market.:Technically, this could have been a good movie though. Given it's many, well tried angles of looking at it. Like deadly, old Rome type spectacles being shifted into a futuristic setting. Or the 1984 kind of healthy rural vs. decadent urban life style antagonism. ""Apocalypto"" type human sacrifice ceremonies, to tame the gods. And even some fashionable media critique - ""it's only a TV show"". A colorful collage to start with indeed. And still failing.Two major reasons: shallow actors, presumably meant to appeal to ""twilight"" type teenie audiences. And shoddy production, likely because they spent too much money on a plethora of big names for supporting roles and had to save it elsewhere.Look e.g. at what could have been a highlight of this film, a feast for the eye: the dance in the flaming dress. They cut that short though, and had to. Because it obviously looked fake, CGI. And in a poor - shoddy - way.Most of the above critique addresses just the first half of the film, the build up, anyway. Because once the kids are down in the woods hunting each other, the film becomes about as original as some boring TV episode about amazons hunting rabbits in a dumbed down fantasy environment. Serious yawner alert certainly applies there.Still two things may be taken away: Miss Lawrence is an actress sporting womanly features, which is rare these days and much appreciated. And Woody's the tutor you want, in any kind of situation, even if suffering from the worst hairdo of his movie career.Bottom line: if older than 16 better bring a cushion to rest your head on."
513,The Hunger Games,1," Didn't read the book - but ugh:If you are going to make a movie about children being forced to kill each other for the enjoyment of the public, I would think that the tone one would reach for would be something more along the lines of Shindler's List or at least a tone of some satirical value. And you would think that the angst, fear, disgust and overall awfulness for the main characters would be a focal point. You would think the blood lust of the watching masses would form a visceral sense of at least moderate horror that would serve as a backdrop to all of this. And most of all you would think that children, even children raised to expect that they might someday have to enter a tournament like this, would struggle with a conflict between fear, innocence, longing for some sense of decency and trying to sort through the confusion to survive. It is something of a stretch to imagine a society in which everyone loves seeing children murder each other. That in itself is a plot line the brings a distorted feeling with it. The movie tries to hide that, or at least neglects to even attempt to address that, by layering this movie in and American Idol feeling. There is no sense of outrage. There is hardly a whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the characters. They are wooden and whitewashed. The most we get in the way of a sense of their overarching dilemma is a few shallow feeling comments and silent looks of stoic concern. The movie seems to present the material in this fashion to make us forget that we are watching children kill each other. It is as though we are watching running man - only with 8 year olds. Who doesn't want to watch a movie where adorable little boys and girls snap each other necks? Or dogs run them down and eat them alive...?If a movie like this is to be done it cannot avoid the moral content without seeming shallow and absently depraved. That is this movie. The core is not attempted. It is like red tails meets running man. I found it absent, vapid and obviously lacking in any real value. It was also a little sick because it didn't even bother for tone whilst presenting the viewer with a mind bending plot. In short, wooden acting, shallow presentation and not at all smart."
514,The Hunger Games,3, Full of guff and done far better before:I knew hardly anything about the title before watching last night but I soon realised that it had to be an adaptation of a teen novel. It was the only way I could justify all the waffle and time wasting that went on. Nearly an hour passed before we even got a sniff of action and even then it was far more interesting in Running Man & Battle Royale.The plot holes gaped and the acting was wooden for the most part - Woody Harrelson was the stand out but that's not saying much.We ended up forwarding through swathes of the film just to try and find something interesting - we failed.Very poor and I hope the book is better or it shows a lack of class from the readership.
515,The Hunger Games,4," Confusing  boring and unpleasant.:When The Hunger Games came out, all non-book fans could think of was Asian flick Battle Royale of which I think is an okay but forgettable movie. Meanwhile, the concept of a televised people vs. people contest always reminded me of Arnie nostalgia-classic The Running Man. In retrospect, it's a pretty cheesy movie, but its execution with all its 80s gritty excess makes the idea chilling and believable in its dystopian world. My biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that never once did I feel the concept fit the world. I think it's a pretty good setup with the idea of a uprising that didn't work and that the upper class would punish them but with a kid v. kid battle to the death? There's something about the film that never once convinced me and it lost me right from the outset.Perhaps this is because the film so far removed from our world that there's no relatable one. On one hand, there's the districts which feel like a cleaned up Deadwood then there's the Baz Lurhman does Dr. Seuss civilized world. There's no believable sense of time transition from how it can get to its opening written setup to this world with its infrequent odd sci-fi flashes. It's trying too hard to have social commentary. Above all there's no heart beyond teenage angsty feelings and no sense of a morality we can relate to - albeit, Stanley Tucci was a delight and I wish he could host everything ever. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence's protagonist is brave and I supported her but the writing was so underdeveloped that I found myself confused at what she was or wasn't doing a lot of the time.The film is just so contrived to try and force the concept to belong in this world. The plot is relatively easy to follow but there's way too many times when I found myself asking ""why are they doing this?"" without explanation and ""why don't they just do this?"" without ruling the alternatives out. I feel like the film never took a moral stance on the killings. Sure, the civilized world find it entertaining/punishment and the Deadwood world finds it tragic, fine, but I'm interested in the internal feelings of the ones actually involved. It just felt like their plan was ""to win"" but strategies were never revealed. Why didn't they just slaughter everyone while they were ""training"" with all the weapons? If they weren't allowed, why didn't the film demonstrate it beyond the few words ""don't fight here""? I never bought it.Maybe their plan was to just survive the best they could and stay hidden, but this was never stated. Why were people making alliances when there could only be one winner? It never made any sense, especially when there was absolutely no character development. Perhaps this is what you get with a film that's about the one thing it can't show with a PG-13 rating and shaky cam. I imagine these kinds of morality and strategy things are in the book and fans are just filling in these gaps by themselves, but The Hunger Games movie just confused and bored me with its slow plot-hole ridden script, unpleasant hook and unsatisfying climax. Give me The Running Man for the dozenth time instead, at least it has a bit of balls when it comes to its action.4/10"
516,The Hunger Games,10," A true game-changer for movies aimed at teens.:Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the ""The Hunger Games"" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.""The Hunger Games"" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too ""hot"" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope ""The Hunger Games"" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league."
517,The Hunger Games,7," The odds?!? Lol   they never favor anyone   :Dystopian future where the wealthy have everything and the poor barely have anything. The wealthy live in the capital, and they poor are divided into 12 districts. Once a year, a male and a female teen (from 12-18) are chosen (or they can volunteer) from each district as tribute to the Capitol, and will participate in the annual Hunger Games (a televised fight to the death)."
518,The Hunger Games,7," Battle Royale for the young ones:I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ..."
519,The Hunger Games,5," Paper thin and watered down:The trouble with this movie is that I'm old enough to have seen many of its antecedents. So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book."
520,The Hunger Games,5," ""Battle Royale"" without the stinger:""The Hunger Games"" was an instant hit when it came out, so I'm pretty sure I'm the last person in this universe to see it. Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts ""Running Man"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""Battle Royale"", but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don't get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don't get much of an action or adventure movie. They're after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn't enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can't act stupid if you're not important to the plot. The main characters don't survive because they're so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there's barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie's got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile."
521,The Hunger Games,8," Family-friendly nastiness!:When a massive movie franchise comes to a close, often a hole can develop in the highly competitive market of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It's 2012, and there's no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?Amazingly, it might be even better.While no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it's the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can't help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It's an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.Where THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn't fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she's still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT's limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can't come soon enough.tinribs27.wordpress.com"
522,The Hunger Games,2," (Battle) Royale with cheese...and a side order of over exaggeration.:So as a movie enthusiast and a Cineworld unlimited card holder i do my fair share of visits to the cinema. Of course when a film garners interest the trailers become more and more prominent; this could be said for the newly released ""Hunger Games:Catching Fire"". Constant trailers and advertisements on TV....which led me to think...well i haven't even seen the first one yet. This led me to take up the opportunity that CineWorld had put before me, in seeing the first film in the Cinema in a one day special showing of the 2012 blockbuster...........but oh how i wish i didn't. Fast Forward to the end of the film and i walk out wondering what all the fuss is about and ahead of me i see an ever growing queue outside of anxious teens awaiting the midnight showing of the sequel. And it hit me like a bullet. This is why there is so much hype. I mean there could be no better an example of teen power than the Twilight saga. And this is very similar. Has any of these nutters seen ""Battle Royale""? That is how you do a film focused on individual survival. That is a film that shows you the depths people will go to survive. It doesn't hide from the violence and it doesn't over complicate it. It is live or die. Simple.Now this farce of a film is more focused on creating a love triangle between Katnis, (Lawrence) Gale (Hemsworth) and Peeta (Hutcherson). All this district nonsense, all this sacrifice, all the deaths...just for a love triangle. That is what the underlying story and forthcoming films are going to be all about; twilight anyone? It is one of the cheesiest films ever; made me cringe so much i was almost sure my spine would snap at any moment. That my head would go all exorcist and just keep going when i constantly turned away in dismay. This film is successful because of the vast amount of teens who are vacuumed into love stories and won't let go until a shirt is taken off. And anyone over the age of 18 who still enjoys this needs to grow up and go watch Battle Royale and that'll show you what would really happen in a circumstance like this.The film takes almost an hour to start and when it does start, it actually doesn't. It's slow, uneventful and the characters they try so hard for you to feel sympathy towards are so incredibly unimportant that you simply don't care.Yet another film, that is over exaggerated, over hyped, over advertised and over the top with cheese.2/10 (and that's me being nice)"
523,The Hunger Games,8," An American Battle Royale!:In the future all wars have ended, but famine and poverty still remain in a new North Amercia, which has been split into 12 Districts. To appease the people, and pay tribute to the fallen, Capitol City have devised The Hunger Games, in which 2 children from each District are chosen to fight to the death live on TV.The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12, and we see them whisked off to Capitol City - a pastel coloured ""Willy Wonka"" style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes, have bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they are treated like royalty, and trained in readiness for the games.Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale' - but without as much blood or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those ""playing"" the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and ""fun"" for the viewers.The film takes a long time to really hit its stride - the opening sequences seemingly go on forever - and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale', as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' (in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses) and even 'Logans Run', but it has enough in it to make it a stand-up, worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative, where - in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their ""Blood and Circuses"" - love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.The production is very good - the future Capitol City looks amazing - whilst the acting ranges from excellent (the young actress playing the lead role is very good), to screen chewing (Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!). The other thing about the film is its length - at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely, but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema (or else take a cushion!)"
524,The Hunger Games,," Not quite ""Battle Royale"":Many have drawn a comparison between ""The hunger games"" and Japanese cult movie ""Battle Royale"". There are obviously similarities, but even more pronounced differences. The best example is the universal graphic violence in BR. In THG, if you observe closely enough, the two protagonists are never directly involved in the executing of killing of the other 22 participants in the ""game"". They are not lily-white innocent, not by any means. But this watering down is intentional. Even with the protagonist aside, the more gory part of the killing is shown only once, at the beginning of the game, through a series of montages with visual images so fleeting that they hardly register. One other point that is emphasized (by an instructor to the protagonists) is that this game is not so much about killing as about surviving. He even quotes statistics – 30 per cent dies of dehydration or exposure, paying too much attention to their knives and not enough to their water supply.Set in a futuristic US when the hub around New York dominates and rules, 12 ruthlessly governed districts each provide two ""tributes"" annually to take part in a brutal survival game from which only one winner is allowed to emerge alive. There is a stark contrast between the ultra-modern, high-tech game design and control rooms and the primitive forest that is the playground. The movie is roughly in two halves. The slightly shorter (about an hour) first half establishing the scene and the second half concentrates on the titular event. The much contested lead role, by three Oscar-nominated young ladies, finally went to Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter bones"") who edged Hailee Steinfeld (""True grit"") and Shailene Woodley (""The descendants""), which seems logical as her Oscar nominee was for Best Actress while the other two's were Best Supporting Actress. And she does prove her worth with a solid performance. In the male lead (which is really a supporting role) is Josh Hutcherson whom I remember favourably from ""The kids are alright"" (2010). Adding pleasure to the movie are appearances in somewhat caricature-like roles by worthy actors like Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson and Toby Jones. Donald Sutherland's appearance is more like a cameo.""The Hunger Games"" is good entertainment, with a reasonably engaging story. Recommended."
525,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,7," This was Wandavision 2  not Doctor Strange 2:I liked this movie and I think it's a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.While I enjoyed the movie overall, it did disappoint some expectations and could have been better. As my review title states, it's more like Wandavision 2 than Doctor Strange 2. I kept wondering, whose movie is it? Elizabeth Olsen steals the show as Wanda, a corrupted demonic figure who fits the ""slasher"" role in this film, but her characterisation was also a bit too single-minded to feel like a real person.The pacing is very strange. It often skips about from one scene to another before they have really been explored or digested, leaving us with only a glimpse. This film feels like the characters are abruptly jumping between several films that have been awkwardly smashed together, unlike the first Doctor Strange film which was extremely focused. Cool scenes like the Illuminati were wasted by being disposed of so quickly. The multiverse isn't really explored beyond red and green being swapped and pizza balls being ""free"".The writing leaves a lot to be desired. As mentioned, this is essentially Wanda's story so nobody else is given much to work with. America Chavez is just there to run away from things, Christine Palmer is just there to give Dr. Strange something to anguish over and Wong is just there for the special effects. There are glimmers of character development but it goes nowhere. We keep seeing that Dr. Strange and Christine Palmer don't work out in any universe, which we already knew, but they keep repeating it for some reason, and it's not a compelling character relationship. Dr. Strange realises that he's really no different from the other versions of him, so he has to accept what he's got in this universe and not pine for things that are out of reach (i.e. Finding happiness without Christine). But he also realises that he can choose to be different from the other versions of him and work for the greater good without throwing anyone under the bus (i.e. Letting America Chavez keep her powers). Which one is it? What does he learn from the other versions of him?On a finer level, the dialogue had lots of problems. It was often very cheesy, like the supposedly inspiring speech Dr. Strange gives to America Chavez near the end. It was also full of blunt exposition, like the encyclopedic infodumps about multiversal powers, the Darkhold, the Vishanti, the Illuminati, Thanos and so on. There are times when it felt like the writing room had an extensive Q&A session where they tried to cover every possible viewer doubt, concern or plot hole, but instead of weaving the details in naturally, they just made the characters parrot their explanations verbatim, which sounded contrived and awkward. For example, there was one scene where the film stops so that Wong can ask Wanda point-blank why she wants full multiversal powers instead of just staying in one universe with her family. This happens a lot during the film.The writer Michael Waldron was chosen because of his experience with multiverse stories, especially Loki. This sounds great until you realise that Waldron has already run out of ideas and just wrote the same story again:Main tension: The powerful protagonist is put in cuffs and deprived of his powers (Loki: Loki; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange).He is brought before a powerful tribunal of celebrity cameos with AI assistants to account for crimes against the natural order. Protagonist responds with snarky remarks (Loki: TVA, Owen Wilson and Miss Minutes; Dr. Strange: Illuminati, Patrick Stewart and Ultron robots).The tribunal has some heroic story for the public, but they are hiding a sinister secret (Loki: Time Keepers maintain the Sacred Timeline; Dr. Strange: Strange sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos).Due to having no powers, the protagonist resorts to hand-to-hand combat in their headquarters (Loki: Loki & Sylvia vs. TVA; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange vs. Illuminati Mordo).They turn out to be staffed by imbeciles who couldn't catch a shoplifter. They are dispatched easily in combat so the plot can continue (Loki: TVA vs. Anyone else; Dr. Strange: Illuminati vs. Wanda).Main plot: A female character is being pursued because she has powerful abilities to transport herself across time and space and keeps evading everyone (Loki: Sylvie with orange portals; Dr. Strange: America Chavez with blue portals).Main threat: A female character possesses the minds of other people to attack (Loki: Sylvie's enchantments; Dr. Strange: Wanda's dreamwalking).Lazy and blunt exposition technique: Protagonist uses a machine to bring his memories to life (Loki: TVA timeline viewer; Dr. Strange: Shop display that projects your past trauma to the whole street).Lazy and blunt character development: Protagonist is forced to encounter an alternate version of a significant female character from his life to make him realise something about himself. She otherwise serves no story purpose (Loki: Simulation of Lady Sif; Dr. Strange: Illuminati Christine Palmer).Eventually, protagonist finds a deranged man who lives alone inside a castle in a post-apocalyptic realm. He knows more about the vaguely defined dangers of the multiverse and must be dispatched (Loki: He Who Remains; Dr. Strange: Sinister Strange).If Disney keeps hiring Waldron to write the same story, I'll save you ticket expenses by explaining the next Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's Peter Parker encounters a universe-hopping Spider-Woman and tries to pursue her to find her secrets. He is captured by the multiversal Peter Parker Posse headed by Tobey Maguire and injected with a serum that neutralises his spider-powers. The film stops so that Maguire can give a half hour lecture about the finer details of the multiverse and how there can only be one Spider-Man per universe otherwise something vaguely bad happens. Spider-Woman arrives and controls the minds of some Peter Parkers and defeats them all in half a minute. Using a memory display machine, she reveals that the Peter Parker Posse isn't protecting the multiverse, they're secretly neutralising all the Spider-People's powers so their loved ones won't be in danger anymore. Spider-Woman turns out to be an alternate Aunt May, making Tom Holland's Spider-Man somehow realise that with great power comes great responsibility. They trace the neutralising serum to the Final Peter Parker, who lives in a universe where every single person got spider powers and misused them, leaving him as the only survivor. His life's mission is now to ensure that nobody ever gets spider powers and claims that ""with NO power comes NO responsibility!"" They defeat him and travel back to all the other universes with radioactive spiders to restore a Spider-Person in each of them. The end. Rinse and repeat for the next ten years."
526,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,5," Well  it was shiny and colourful:So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.And her redemption arc is she notices she is a monster and ends her reign of terror in the last 2 minutes.And we're meant to sympathise with her for those heinous acts because she is sad because she had to stop imagining her children, and had to stop all the slaving and torture she was doing in order to imagine some fake imaginary children.It was loud and shiny and stupid, so it was fine as totally brainless, lightweight nonsense... Pretty meh overall, and I stopped paying attention during some parts as I was thinking about other things because it was not engaging at all."
527,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6," Not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness:Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own."
528,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2," Scarlet Witch: The Movie  ft: Sorcerer Supremes:Great visuals, actors and actresses do their best to make it believable. Benedict Wong's character proves to be a bad-ass. Olsen also does her best. Cumberbatch is as usual. No bad things there. Even the cameos can, at some level, sell the plot points.OK!There is one important plot hole: at the end of WandaVision, Wanda learns hot to neutralize other people's magic. She does that at the magnitude of a town. In this movie, instead of using that same magic and by-pass the Sorcerer Supremes and their wizards, she tortures and kills them. Why?One important issue in character development: Wanda learns that her happiness means nothing if it is based on other people's misery at the end of WnadaVision. In this film, she has completely forgotten that lesson and at the end she learns it, again! Come on! Writers! Learn to respect these characters!Disney identity politics: Wanda kills the 3 male cameos (Picard, Jim from the Office, and some guy) easily. Literally, with her mind. OK. But she fights Carter and Captain Marvel, and Captain Marvel dies because of a statue falling on her! The same Captain Marvel, who pierced a hole in Thanos's spaceship, dies because of rubble?!And of course, she does not look for a universe where Vision is still alive.If you have noticed, I did not mention Dr. Strange. It is because Dr. Strange has NO function or importance in this movie. Cut out his scenes completely, and the plot will not change.In a Dr. Strange movie, Dr. Strange does not matter, at all.Edit: other than the VFX scenes, the worst photography and the worst editing in MCU."
529,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,4," Terrible plot and script  boring and pointless:I always had some issues with MCU films but now they aren't even entertaining? Oh Raimi, what a disappointment. I honestly only liked the horror elements and being able to see some blood in a MCU film. Nothing else.The plot is super weak - the worst of the film - but the script is also very erroneous with some strange and unexplainable writing decisions. There are some interesting shots - some Dutch angles and POV are cool - but this feel stupidly long for a film that is just 2 hours long. It's like watching the action going from setpiece to setpiece in a very inorganic way while travelling between boring universe with a lot of cringe dialogue. I don't even get the point of all this story for the entire universe and even the score - surprisingly considering that is Elfman - is super generic.I won't lie: I had much more fun watching Eternals, Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman 1984 than this one. Said it."
530,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,5," Convuluted story  just like the multiverse:Doctor Strange became a very popular character, especially after the Endgame events and had a good share of performance in couple of MCU movies thereafter. Multiverse of madness was on a different hype level, however it turned out to be a disappointment affair on some levels.Starting with the storyline, the plot of multiverse and Scarlet Witch as the antagonist was a cool idea, however the execution didn't reciprocate the idea of the story. The first half was decent, with very good special effects and some action with a lot of multiverse moments, that even we weren't able to catch up with the pace of the movie.The main downfall started just as the second half started. Too many characters introduction, with less development of the ongoing story, a lacklustre special effects in many scenes and the shockingly quick pace of the story made the climax very less interesting towards the end. Direction by Sam Raimi was good, but felt flat towards the last 20 minutes or so, of the movie.Putting aside any long-term implications, The Multiverse Of Madness is a frustrating mix of eclectic elements that at times feel more like Raimi referencing his Evil Dead movies than his previous superhero work. Suffice it to say that Multiverse of Madness may find rapturous approval among comic book fans but could be less appealing to mainstream movie-goers.My Rating : 5/10."
531,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,3, Didnt make much sense:Plot holes all over the place. Lots of things didnt make sense. Wanda made her kids with magic but couldnt do it again. She could astro project to another universw where the kids were and could send demons thru the multiverse but couldnt travel herself. She killed the one she loved but felt nothing when she did but somehow we are supposed to believe she loves the kids she doesnt have?All nonsense.
532,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6," somewhere in the multiverse  there's a better version of this movie that exists.:The overall pacing is relentless and the sequel shows its hand a lot earlier than you'd expect. There's been endless speculation from fans about the villain, which i won't spoil here, but it's revealed surprisingly quickly.You can't help that feel somewhere in the multiverse, there's a better version of this movie that exists."
533,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,3," Greedy Disney's going to wreck our favorite movie franchises!:They obviously believe in the ""quantity vs. Quality"" business theory, and seem quite content to continue pumping out these mediocre entries in the Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar brands, until their formerly dedicated audiences finally cry ""enough!"", and just...walk away, shaking their collective heads at how sad it was, the day The Mouse bought the rights to these storied franchises. My only remaining hope is that they'll pump the breaks and not try to oversaturate us with the two best remaining storylines - those being the wonderfully heart-filled Ant Man and Spider-Man series, which are the only ones (so far) they haven't managed to ruin. MFF/Honolulu 7-23-22."
534,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,3," Pretentious nonsensical hokum:Richard Burton wasted his talents on alcohol. Let's hope Benedict Cumberbatch doesn't waste his talent on Marvel. What does it take, time wise, for him to make one of these derivative, adolescent wastes of cinematic energy? How many real films might he make, how many plays might he contribute to, were he not involved in this childish pablum?"
535,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6," Seems Rushed For A Two-Hour Movie:Xochitl Gomez shows up from an alternate reality and asks for Benedict Cumberbatch's help. She can travel between the various realities, but she has no control over it; when she's in a life-threatening situation, she autonomically zips into a a different world. She's been doing that a lot, since monsters have been attacking her to steal her ability. This is at least the second Dr. Strange she's asked for help -- here's the corpse of another.For reasons of the plot, Cumberbatch goes to Elizabeth Olsen, aka The Scarlet Witch for help. Waddaya know, she's been controlling the demons because she wants to get to an alternate world where she has children -- thus linking into the Disney+ show, Wandavision.Sam Raimi is back directing, and he borrows liberally, not only from earlier superhero movies, but from horror movies. This one has fewer quips than your average Marvel movie, but it does ask questions both overtly ""Are you happy?"" and symbolically. It's not my principal interest, but at a tad over two hours, my bladder didn't force me out of the theater."
536,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,4," Time to retire the MCU:After months of hype, we are left with a mess of a story that is mostly just CGI blobs, some light shows and some boring dialogue. I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.Firstly, you're not going to have any idea what's going on with the main antagonist unless you watched the Disney+ show Wandavision. Even though I did watch it, it had been months, and I didn't remember all the details, so her whole backstory fell flat. This movie was less about Strange and more about her.There's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.There's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.There's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.Seriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back. Let's just face it, Hollywood milked all they could from Marvel. It's time to give the franchise ( and maybe all superhero movies)a good 10-15 year rest and reboot it after audiences grow nostalgic."
537,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2," Very uninteresting:It's actually boring most of the time. When there's something actually going on, it's mostly not interesting. I mean, for stuff to be interesting, there has to be some semblance of sense, but none of this makes any sense, not compared to the real world, itself, or other stuff in this MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse). I mean, we have Wanda destroying the Multiverse and very, very few people show up to defend it. And that's just the most obvious thing, there's like a gazillion things that are utter nonsense.Jokes are almost all one-liners and only one really works, with just a few others which are OK. America Chavez is not nearly as cute as everybody wants her to be. Rachel McAdams is way past her primer and it shows that she was never that good of an actress, she was just playing on her cute. Professor X cameo is pretty wasted (it's like seeing a bad episode of ""Picard"" show) and would have been better if he just came in, said ""Hi, and sorry, I must go"". Similar goes for Hayley Atwell. John Krasinski cameo as Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four is such an obvious nod to fans that it doesn't have much impact (and Mr. Fantastic is much more interesting character). The ""action"" scenes are so silly one can't say they are good or interesting, except in a few interesting action moments, but, in 2 hours, that's way too little.Towards the end it goes into horror movie mode, but, in this setting it feels more like a parody or simply ""so bad it's not scary, but not so bad is funny"" such as the Evil Dead; which kind of makes sense, giving that Bruce Campbell has a cameo.Quite frankly, I don't see the ""emotional impact"" that critics are talking about. Sure, there are attempts, but, they are bad, superficial, badly acted, unrealistic and nonsensical.Unless you are a big fan of Dr Strange or of horror movies, I can't think of a reason for watching this. The one good one-liner will surely make its way to social media soon, so you won't miss anything."
538,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2," Scooby Doo Meets Ghost Busters in nonsense fest:I rolled my eyes at this film in disbelief.This is just a fan service film , an absolute nonsense 'fan mash up'.Incoherent from start to finish, at best the plot was non sensical, at worst non-existant.What makes it more bizarre is the cast of such good actors in such an appalling film.Do not waste your money.2/10If this wasn't enought the CGI was shockingly bad and make up appalling and make up prosthetics amateur.I gather they did multiple reshoots of the film at the last minute, clearly this has been a disaster."
539,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,4," Disappointing:I can't believe I am writing a bad Marvel review but I can't lie, this movie was really disappointing. A couple of surprises but I was expecting way more after watching No way home....
Didn't mind the horror side of the story, actually made me laugh. As for the music , I am a huge fan of Danny Elfman but even the music was bad.I won't watch this one again. Marvel we are used to greatness please don't do that again!"
540,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,5," Multiverse of... Something-ness:Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work. At least it tried."
541,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,4," Another failure by Disney  Big Fail!:Let me say that it just doesn't follow any of the original Stan Lee Marvel Comics.Possibly the Worst of all the Movies made this far.I feel terrible for Dr. Strange and The Scarlet Witch for having their characters so discombobulated.If you can just buy anything that Disney shoved down your throat, than you will love this movie.Just Ughfull."
542,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,4," Cannot explain my disappointment:I could have actually cried watching this. Dr. Strange is one of my favourite Marvel movies but this was just plain awful. 1 hour in and I was debating leaving. Marvel are losing their touch, and ever since Endgame, it just hasn't felt the same, apart from NWH. Sam Raimi messed up big time."
543,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2, Dr Stupid in the Mashed Potatoes:Really!@#$ Can you make a more stupid film? Were the writers stoned and when they wrote the script? It's just one silly scene after another. Did I mention the terrible acting? Did they get paid for this? If it weren't for the great special effects this film would be completely worthless.
544,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,5," Hugely disappointing mess:This movies suffers the same fate as Spiderman no way home - ie good plot idea broadly and massively underwhelming execution. In particular the story boarding, script, music and direction is very poor.The pace of this movie is it's biggest weakness.., first 15 mins race through motivations but other scenes painfully slow. Corny scenes like walking slow from the person Yoire outrunning so they can catch up... or phew a door you never saw before to save you...Wanda's motivation for being the main antagonist is paper thin snd seems to have all transpired off screen... what a cop out for a character that we all watched have an almost redemption in WandaVision.Another huge dissatisfaction is the plotting story board... sub plots don't go anywhere.. in fact about sn hour of this movie to find the 'shanti' book mean absolutely nothing to the story. Total waste of time.Intro to fantastic 4 and x men was beyond a let down... again it went nowhere and such a waste.Climax of the film ends when Wanda sees her children afraid of who she's become... literally 5 seconds after telling strange that doesn't care. Oh snd ps there are infinite universes so just go another one where your kids don't see you as a witch? Or maybe find a universe where they are orphans? Why is she obsessed with this one universe? Just doesn't track.Also the wokeness.... It's bad when it's this obvious... but a mixed race girl (the bestest ever), lesbiss as k parents and all she has to do is believe in herself... ticks all the boxes...Death of scarlet witch was a hugely wrong move in my opinion... I was waiting for the end credit scene to say 'hey all this happened in another universe too' but that never happened. Hopefully it does in a later film and this whole movie is rec conned."
545,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,4," When marvel goes too far...:Is it me or is this the most baffling marvel film there is? Is there a plot or a story? It just seemed to be nonsense. A film should make sense whether you are a big fan or a novice. I like Marvel but I'm a casual viewer. I don't want to watch a film where it's like, ""you need to watch film 23 and episode 9 of season 1 to understand the plot. Loved the first film too. This is literally madness."
546,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,5," Dr strange 2 More like WandaVision 2:I really miss the old MCU movies where it was making a stand alone super hero movie is simple,
But after (End game) thing changed for better or worse.-During watching the movie I kept wondering, whose movie is it?-Sam Raimi did a great job.i liked the fight scene , the horror elements he adds to the movie it was creative,But it wasn't enough.-The writing was bad and very cheesy.-Where is (Vision ,loki ,TVA ) ??the anticipated heroes cameo were wasted by the worst possible way and disposed of so quickly.-Don't watch it with high exceptions."
547,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,5," What A Mess! I Want My 2 Hours Back!:This definitely wasn't what I expected. It started out good and I was thinking: All Right, Here we go. But that didn't last very long. Then it got so chaotic and scattered. It went everywhere and nowhere. Because you couldn't follow it in a meaningful way. I won't give any spoilers. I'll just say that I was highly disappointed. And once I got past the half-hour mark, I actually considered walking out. This film deserved a better script and a more appropriate director. Raimi wasn't the best choice for a Doctor Strange film. Other stuff he's directed, I love. But this was a Hot Mess!"
548,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6," Unfortunate decline in story:Man, what a disappointment, expected way more interesting plot as Strange is one of the coolest and most powerful characters - at least so far it seemed, as Wanda just mopped the floor with him and kinda everybody. She is waaaay more overpowered than supposed to and her motive as a main villain? Being with her children in another universe... Rather unoriginal, kinda we got that in Wandavision. The sensation hunting with other universe's characters were not used well or interestingly whatsoever, while that america chavez girl is just a terrible actor with zero chemistry with the stars. Just a weak story, badly used characters, way too much nonsensical ""fight"", was a missed opp, really hoped marvel can still be on that level than before Endgame, however seems Spiderman was the last big hit that was spot on. Thor is the last hope, the rest is seemingly ruined or much lower quality than the predecessors."
549,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,1," Terrible:This was by far the worst marvel so far. The plot was all over the place bringing in all these characters that had no purpose. I wish they would just stop trying to create avengers within avengers, just ruins it."
550,DC League of Super-Pets,8," Sure To Be A Fan Favorite - Full Of Classic Crime Fighting Battles As Well As Heartfelt Messages:DC League of Super-Pets is sure to be a fan favorite for kids who love superheroes and animals! This animated movie is full of classic crime fighting battles as well as heartfelt messages, making it a perfect family movie.Superman (John Krasinski) and Krypto (Dwayne Johnson), the Super-Dog, have been best friends since birth. When the entire Justice League is kidnapped, Krypto must create a crime fighting league of his own, so he enlists the help of shelter pets Ace (Kevin Hart), Merton (Natasha Lyonne), PB (Vanessa Bayer) and Chip (Diego Luna) to save the Justice League and all of Metropolis.The animation is beautiful! The characters' designs, especially the pets, are so adorable and keep a cartoonish and comic book-like feeling. The humor is great; it pokes fun at other studios (like Marvel Studios) and also at itself (DC Comics), making it relatable to teens and adults who have seen the more serious Marvel and DC movies. The voice acting is outstanding. Everyone fits their roles so well and they really bring their characters to life, displaying each one's unique personality. The actors that stand out the most are Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Natasha Lyonne and Kate McKinnon. Dwayne Johnson as Krypto and Kevin Hart as Ace are a dynamic duo as their chemistry is so apparent - no doubt due to the many times they have worked together in other films. Natasha Lyonne perfects the voice of Old Lady Merton. Her comedic timing is spot on. Kate McKinnon, as Lulu happens to be my favorite character, but I can't say why as I don't want to give away any spoilers. What I can say is that her role appears to be written specifically for her.The primary message of DC League of Super-Pets is that friendship, teamwork and love is stronger than any superpower. There are also themes of moving on and making room for new loved ones. Plus, this movie may inspire people to adopt animals from a shelter. I know I'm ready to!I give DC League of Super-Pets 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus pet and superhero lovers! It releases in theaters July 29, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!"
551,DC League of Super-Pets,9," I recently turned 30 a few days ago and I really enjoyed League of Super-Pets:So much character development and love able story all around, such a blast for a cartoon movie! Better than a lot of DC films this deserves any hype. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have collaborated at least 6 times which makes sense they are perfect together. I like how Kate McKinnon was in Wonder Woman 1982 and in this she's an ultimate villain. Furry greatness for most anyone!"
552,DC League of Super-Pets,9," Keeping in mind it's not for adults  its a great children's film.:It's not bad. It's not bad at all.I think story wise I was expecting it to go down differently, but I like the animation and it was humorous for what it wasAnd once again The Rock and the Hart are a perfect team. I can't complain about that. They got charisma.It's definitely designed for little children but as an adult, I took a likening to it because it makes for a great parody of the DC Superheroes."
553,DC League of Super-Pets,8," I think adults will like it too:We've seen tons of superhero movies before, but few of them about animal superheroes. This is probably why this is one of the few theatrically released animated superhero movies ever made. It works wonderfully as fully CGI! The movie tells the story of Superman's dog, Krypto, who's jealous of him marrying Lois Lane. An evil guinea pig named Lulu belonging to Lex Luthor gets a hold of orange kryptonite, which gives superpowers to animals. The other animals in the pet store get them but are bad at their powers and must team up with Krypto, who's been weakened from green kryptonite to save an also weakened Superman.Apart from having great voices and creative action scenes, this is an all-around feel-good film. Sure, the lessons about friendship and loyalty aren't that unique, but the setup is. We get some really good jokes along the way, and it's spiced up with interesting and creative action scenes, which are to be expected with animal superheroes. I was impressed by the pacing and thought it was only 90 minutes long. This is like the third movie this year I've seen (or heard of) that had Batman in it. He's practically omnipotent! ***"
554,DC League of Super-Pets,7," Superpets Review: Such a Surprise:Now, I was not going to check this film out. I mean, the trailers weren't bad, but I felt as if it was just going to be a Poop-Fart Joke filled movie. The Positive Reception that came with the Early Reviews was so surprising that it got me to buy a ticket. I came home a couple hours ago, and it wasn't groundbreaking or anything, but it was a nice, heartfelt fun time at the movies.This movie is cute, action-packed, heartfelt and... emotional. All the characters were fun and likeable, specifically Krypto and Ace, Batman's Dog. The movie gave Ace a backstory that was very touching and it hits you in the feels, which I was definitely NOT expecting. The animation looks pretty good on the Big Screen, but isn't anything crazy. I found it WAY better than what I expected. To be fair, yes, it did have Poop, Fart and Pee Jokes, but I think the heartfelt, emotional nature of the movie overshadowed the jokes.If you own a Dog, or any Pet and are a DC Fan, I recommend checking the film out because it's a nice, fun time and a good way to spend an Hour and a half. Enjoyable, fun and heartfelt: I would give DC: League of Super-Pets a 7/10 (For reference, I gave Minions 2 a 6 and Lightyear an 8)"
555,DC League of Super-Pets,6," Surprisingly competent and charming:I'll admit, the trailer for this movie made me groan every time I saw it over the past few months. I'm pleased to report that the trailer showcases some of the worst parts of the movie.Granted, the biggest issue I had with this was that the humor just does not land most of the time. The writers felt the need to put a joke in every 10 seconds, regardless of whether it's clever or not. And it's not that it's ""kid-humor"" that I just didn't get as a 25-year-old man. Even the kids in my theater were silent most of the time.However, I'd say about 10% of the jokes actually did work for me and I belly-laughed several times, which I did not expect.Now, the most pleasant surprise of this experience for me was the characters. They're all very distinct and have very clear traits, quirks, and flaws that they work through emotionally through the story.Even though it's a story that's as formulaic, cliched, and predictable as it gets, I found it effortlessly watchable as just about every scene has a very cathartic moment for at least one of the characters. This film actually got me to care about these animal characters despite its absurd silliness.I suppose it's nothing I haven't seen before, but it was so colorful and purely competent that I can't knock on it too hard.There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. This is a relax-on-a-weekend-with-the-family kind of movie."
556,DC League of Super-Pets,9," Multi-Paws:You know like Multiverse but with pets .. as in Multi-Paws? Does that pun actually work? You'll be the judge of that. You also be the judge of this changing the (back)story of all the DC characters ... well maybe not all. But since it does change how Superman came to Earth ... or rather with whom ... well let's call it one more timeline ""to follow"". If you can dig it that is.Still the movie is super fun. Whether you are a fan of the comics or not (I actually am not even sure if there is a comic book universe where they explored the pets idea, but I imagine there is at least one). That being said, the fact that Black Adam himself (the Rock also known as Dwayne Johnson) is doing the voice of one of the dogs ... might be quite mind blowing to some ... gets even better if you watch it through the end. And by the way when I say to through the end, I mean there are scenes after the movie is over. That is mid credit scene and after credit scene. And they both are worth the wait - even if everyone else has left the building (the theatre in my case).Good fun with a lot of great voice acting/actors. Animated movies have stepped their game up."
557,DC League of Super-Pets,7," A lot of fun!:DC League of Super-Pets (2022) follows Krypto the super dog and his new friends as they aim to save the justice league from a new villain. I had a great time watching this film, it may not have been perfect but it was an amusing and easy watch!The characters were fun, with easy-to-digest flaws and a lot of likeable qualities. Natasha Lyonne's Merton was a stand-out! The voice acting was pretty good and the film was full of famous names which honestly really surprised me!The humour in this movie was something I didn't expect to like, but ended up really enjoying! There were some witty one-liners that had me chuckling, and some pretty well thought out jokes. The humour was, obviously, surface level, but I really liked this about it as it made for a very entertaining watch.The animation was good and had its own style, however unfortunately I didn't really like it all that much. The main villain, Lulu the Guinea pig, didn't look much like a Guinea pig at all and was somewhat confusing. The animation was a bit too strange and not so easy on the eye.The soundtrack for the film was great, and included loads of well known tracks. The music used kept my attention and made the film even more fun to watch in the cinemas. It included a broad range of genres too but this all worked!Lastly, the plot was very surface level, but this wasn't a bad thing, and the pacing was fairly steady and fast. The plot was laid out well and explained everything in very simple terms which is understandable due to it being targeted at children. The fast pacing was a good decision as it doesn't allow the audience time to become bored."
558,DC League of Super-Pets,8," Family's Best Friend For Fun Movie Going:LIKES:The Animation: When it comes to animation, there are very few films that are going to crap out at this part of the movie. DC Super-pets has a nice flow that allows there characters to move in the heroic style you expect. It's smooth, it does not take too many clunky shortcuts to get the shot, and works well to match the style of the character and voice actor. While there is definitely some realism to it though, the designers did keep the comic book/cartoon mojo to it and I was impressed with how much of a little kid I felt in me while watching it. All of it works together to make the adventure fun and enjoyable to watch, without feeling stuck in an outdated computer game.The Cute Factor: I could go on for hours about the cute factor of this movie, but parents rest in relief, because the movie is indeed very cuddly for your group. Cursing/semi-swear words are at a minimum, dark natured elements are toned down to G or PG levels, and there should be very few things to scare or scar your kids. The movie has plenty of family friendly moments that can melt many hearts, and will probably inspire you to be kind to your pets or adopt.The Voice Acting: Alright now onto the people who brought the character part of the group to life. Voice acting is an amazing art as I've said before, and so many people accomplished the directions they were taking with various parties in the movie. John Krasinski as Superman was sensational in his fun and yet mature manner that was like serious Jim from the Office. While Natasha Lyonne may have been my favorite performance of the bunch with her balanced humor and turtle like mafia voice. Yet the big three get the focus, so let's center on them for a moment. McKinnon is a master of so many roles, and Lulu is no exception as the hairless guinea pig role that is like one of her SNL skits come to life, only censored. If you love seeing, or in this case, hearing her rants and overenthusiastic delivery, get ready for about 90 minutes of it. It works well for this type of movie and I had fun hearing her play the sassy self in animal form quite well. Hart is also pretty much playing his deck of cards again that he has made him so famous. He rants, does montages with the same type of fire, and his comedy about being put into situations was very fun, but I loved seeing the vulnerable side come out with it to help balance the comedy and character of Ace. He does well to play with the Rock as expected, and this movie keeps their friendship in real life well-integrated into the characters of Krypto and Ace to the point of being very entertaining. As for Johnson, he's still the same guy you love to watch on the screen, only in a CGI, white dog form. He does Krypto decently, giving the kid humor element the biggest punch of the actors, while sometimes nailing those overdramatic moments that a superhero film is noted to have. I can't say he did the best of the bunch, but his style of working with all the other voice actors was very balanced, and always maintained that comedic style I love to see. All in all, this cast did better than I thought and could play very well together for a future, most likely impending series.The Humor: Now we are getting to my favorite elements of the bunch, the humor of the movie. The trailers show it's primarily for kids, and to be honest, it does have a lot of things geared towards a younger audience. Slapstick humor and annoying lines are in this movie, and as my showing showed are very repeatable by those who like to parrot lines. Fret not though parents, because surprisingly this film will have adult moments placed in as well, comedy lines and items that you'll quite enjoy at the fourth-dimension breaking or genre poking moments that are very funny. It's not quite like the 90s style of cartoons, but there are plenty of geeky humor moments that fans like myself will enjoy amongst the juvenile role. Hinted earlier was Merton, a turtle whose lines were probably the best example of them both. She is one of the most adult themed moments of the bunch and I was cracking up at the elevated jokes they wrote and put in for this film. Bleeped out cursing, references to history and even some other experiences she thinks about in the film. It's a nice balance and keeps the entire audience into the movie as opposed to watching your kids just laugh.The Touching Moments: Perhaps the biggest surprise was how touching the movie was for me and how many things they put in for character development that actually made me feel moved. I can't say much, but the movie really addresses some relevant topics for me and a surprisingly healthy approach to solving them. Ace and Krypto have the most focus on the moments, alongside a few others getting surprisingly decent approaches to their character quirks. This was a great choice for me and I absolutely loved the development of the characters to elevate the movie past the kid element. I can't say you will have your eyes watering, but you might just say aww, a few times.The Pace Balance: Kids movies kind of suck at pace balancing these days, doing their best to be the flash in the pan that modern attention spans are. They drop character development and story design for quirks or political moments and then hope your kids are prone to rewatching things. However, DC Super-pets surprised me again by keeping things running well and not sacrificing the storytelling elements that a good movie has. This pace again appeals to both older and younger audiences and I strongly appreciate not using this as a throw away movie for merchandising.The Character Utilization: Yep, this part is important to me, and they did it quite well in the film. Almost all characters introduced have a significant impact on the movie and I loved having them balance things out, keeping them all a part of the grand adventure and bringing a good element to the film. Given how many characters they had to juggle, this is no easy merit and I was very pleased with the movie and how well they kept all character involved.DISLIKES:The Design Of The Human Characters: While the animation is smooth, I don't think the design was as much of a win for me in this film. Most of the animals in this film are what you expect a DC Super-Pets to look like and match the style I saw in the cartoons I used to be stuck on as a kid. However, the humans design seems a little more driven to be caricatures as if it's some warped perspective of the pets. There could be other design elements that inspired, but for the limited use they were in, the design did little for me compared to the pets they designed in this particular movie. Minor to some, but there are better superhero designs in other installments.The Action Needs A Little Tweaking For Next Time: An action lover like me is not the biggest fan of seeing the amount of censorship that the world has become in this element. Super-pets is not the worst of the bunch to yield to modern tinkering, but it still has a long way to go to match what 80s-90s cartoons did. In a world about talking animals with extraordinary abilities, a little bit more zest to the fighting ups the suspense element that gives it a little more zest. Some fights utilize the comic design well, but a few that were supposed to be epic, were kind of meh in my book and given the cartoons I grew up with, don't need to be so pulled.The Political Component That Snuck In: It seems we can't necessarily go a movie without diving a little more into the popular trend of being political. Super-pets dive into this part is much less than other films, I can't say that going out of our way to put it in was needed. We'll see if this springs at more, and fortunately does not get in the way of the story too much, but time will tell if this seed is going to sprout into an arc down the line.A Few Moments Of Stale/Forced Humor: Yep, can't really get around this in a kid's movie when it comes to the forced elements of comedy. This film has plenty of moments that are timed well and a few that don't fit in and yet get hammered away to the point that nail is rusted and stale. Minor in most moments given all the balance of the film, but something that does get in the way.Predictable: What movie really isn't anymore? Super-Pets main weakness is that it's a little more pronounced in the introduction of elements you know are going to be seen in the movie. It's not casual, it's not clever, and is so pronounced that you can't help but figure out where the movie is going to go with its plot, which sort of robs of the spectacle at the end. Again minor for the target audience, but something I tend to wish could be avoided.The VERDICT:When it comes to animated movies, this was a film that was a nice surprise and I really did enjoy the wonderful piece they brought. It is a kid's movie through and through, but the team managed to finally craft with it something all family members can enjoy. The film is balanced on many levels, helping to show you can have fun with the kids and still make a good story feature as well. Super-pets league has plenty to offer in the way of fun voice acting, good laughs, and animation that utilizes a lot of things that I enjoy in my movies. And though I enjoyed much, there are still a few shortcomings that the kid movie element has with it. This includes predictability, design elements, and some forced aspects like political popularity and humor. Still despite the punches that did not need to be pulled as much, the movie overall is one of the better animated films I've seen for the summer and would give this movie a solid movie theater going if you could. My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8-8.5
Movie overall: 7.5."
559,DC League of Super-Pets,7," What You Would Expect.:I had the privilege to see this film at an early screening and being a comic fan, I was actually looking forward to this.Without spoiling anything, the plot is essentially Superman's dog and other dogs with powers saving the Justice League. I can't imagine that I've spoiled anything because you could see that plot coming a mile away.With that said, the film is exactly what you would expect, nothing more or less. While that might not sound groundbreaking, it's not a bad thing either. It's charming, can be extraordinarily funny, and the voice acting is great. Granted, it is really tough to hear Dwayne Johnson's voice in an animated movie and not picture the character of Maui from Moana.However, I can't see this being a movie for everyone. The League of Super Pets has always divided a good chunk of the comic fanbase. Some love it and some hate it, it really depends on not only your taste but what you really grew up on in entertainment. The comic series was never as edgy or groundbreaking as its peers and the movie certainly stays along those lines.So overall, I personally really like this film. It's fun and entertaining from start to finish. It's not nearly as dramatic as some of DC's most recent work, which I personally view as a blessing."
560,DC League of Super-Pets,8," A fun movie to watch.:Krypto the Super-Dog and Superman are inseparable best friends, sharing the same superpowers and fighting crime side by side in Metropolis. However, when the Man of Steel and the rest of the Justice League are kidnapped, Krypto must convince a ragtag group of animals to master their own newfound powers for a rescue mission.When first going to see this movie I didn't know how to feel as I thought I might be to old to see a cartoon meant for children but I ended really liking this movie. The animation is so good and the voice acting is incredible but what do you expect when you get Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Heart in this movie with tons of other well known and talented actors like Keanu Reeves and John Krasinski just to name a few. The humour is really meant for children which I didn't find funny but I see how kids may find it. And there is even a really emotional scene that made me cry a little.Overall this is a really good movie to take your kids to!"
561,DC League of Super-Pets,8," One of the Best DC Films Ever:Krypto had been Kal-el's pet and companion since he was an infant launched into space by his parents during the destruction of their home planet Krypton. As Kal-el eventually became Superman, Krypto had always been his mission partner and only friend. However, time came when Superman was spending more time with Lois Lane and planned to marry her. When Clark brought him to an animal shelter to find a new friend for him, Krypto felt very depressed.The unadopted pets in the animal shelter include boxer dog Ace, pot-bellied pig PB, blind turtle Merton, red squirrel Chip, and Lex Luthor's hairless guinea pig Lulu. One day, evil Lulu got herself a piece of orange kryptonite which gave her superpowers to fulfill her dreams of world domination. When Superman and the rest of the Justice League were abducted, the other shelter pets with their newly-acquired powers help Krypto to rescue them.Watching the closing credits reveal who the voice actors were behind the various characters was very enjoyable. It was surprising to see a lot of A-list actors on the list, including Dwayne Johnson (as Krypto), Kevin Hart (as Ace), John Krasinski (as Superman), Natasha Lyonne (as Merton), Diego Luna (as Chip), SNL stars Kate McKinnon (as Lulu) and Vanessa Bayer (as PB), and my personal favorite -- Keanu Reeves (as Batman).This actually turned out to be one of the best DC films ever released, live or animated. Writer-director Jared Stern was also behind ""Lego Batman Movie"" (2017) and his sense of humor was fun and familiar. It was very rich in Superman (with echoes of the 1976 Richard Donner film) and Justice League lore sure to entertain serious and casual DC superhero fans. There were even a few sly Marvel references (Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic and others) to boot.This is also a most delightful film for pet-lovers of all ages. The relationships of various pets and their masters were very well-explored here. Dog owners, especially, would be able to identify with the stories of Krypto and Ace. As would be expected from a movie about pets, there would be a lot of emotional moments throughout with sentimental scenes of man-animal interactions which would surely warm even the hardest of hearts. 8/10."
562,DC League of Super-Pets,10," Fun and cute:I wish it was longer, but it is for kids. I really liked this movie. I loved the pet villains and heroes. I thought it was fun and cute.The animation was great.. The story telling was humorous and with a lot of personality.I loved how they brought in different characters for cameos."
563,DC League of Super-Pets,9," This is how to do the DCU:Superman's dog Krypto is set on sabotaging his owner's relationship with Lois Lane when an orange kryptonite meteorate confers superpowers on assorted pet shop pets and the Justice League ends up needing help. Unfortunatelly, Krypto lost his powers.This cartoon treats the DC universe far more kindly than much of its live-action cousin has done in recent years. In particular, it remembers to be Fun. It has a strong story, plenty of humour, a lot of heart, a great voice cast, terrific animation, it plays fair with all the characters, and works for both kids and an older audience.In short, it is everthing which its dark, cynical, depressing, sour live-action cousin isn't."
564,DC League of Super-Pets,10," Funny as hell:A high-concept animated film about animals with superpowers is brought to vibrant, endearing life by the superpowers behind the scenes: lively voice talent from an all-star cast, a script that is smart, exciting, and very funny, and, above all, the ability to tap into one of humanity's deepest emotions, our love for our pets and theirs for us. Comedy too often comes from a place of skepticism, opposition, or irony. But here, the most hilarious moments come from a deep understanding of and affection for comics. But the more you love the world of superheroes, the more you will appreciate seeing Superman toss his pet dog, Krypto, a squeaky toy shaped like Batman. And you will appreciate it even more when my new favorite Batman, voiced by Keanu Reeves, comments darkly. Krypto and Superman (John Krasinski) have been best friends since Kryptonians Jor-El and Lara tucked tiny Kal-El into a rocket ship as their planet was exploding and puppy Krypto jumped in at the last minute to keep the future Clark Kent/Superboy company. In present day they work as a team to keep everyone safe from bad guys, both those from Earth and those from other planets. Krypto loves being Superman's best friend even more than he likes saving the world. That is until Superman starts spending a lot of time with his girlfriend, intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde). And then a very powerful supervillain uses green Kryptonite to take away Superman's powers and holds him and the rest of the Justice League captive. What do we need to show us the group getting control of their new superpowers? A training montage, of course, as the animals tell us. They need to master their skills and teamwork to rescue the Justice League from Lulu, who thinks she will endear herself to Lex Luthor by out-evil-ing him. Lessons about friendship and the unconditional love we get from and give to our pets are sweetly delivered in ""DC League of Super-Pets."" This vibrant film's action and comedy have all the zing that has bolstered our unconditional love for comics and superheroes on the brink of its second century."
565,DC League of Super-Pets,4," Weak:This is a pretty weak attempt at an animated action-comedy. I laughed at about 5% of the jokes, chuckled at 30%, and was dead silent for the rest. I think Kevin Hart is funny but he adds almost no comedic value to this role. The story/dialogue/characters don't do anything to help.I'm not an animation snob and I rarely notice or complain about bad animation, but I was really surprised by how bad most of it looked. You could see separate parts of the face moving/stretching/squeezing independently rather than as a whole. No idea if this was a stylistic choice, but I didn't like it.I compare this to Minions: Rise of Gru from a few weeks ago, which I LOVE. It's very similar in so many ways yet completely superior. The animation is amazing and mesmerizing, it's hilarious and the action is a delicious cherry on top. Super-Pets follows so many beats, almost like a template, but pales in comparison, especially with the climactic action scene.I didn't hate watching this movie, but it's definitely not good. Watch The Lego Batman Movie instead, it's amazing and hilarious. (1 viewing, 8/3/2022)"
566,DC League of Super-Pets,7," Pets Taking Over For The Heroes:I saw DC League of Super_Pets, starring the voices of Dwayne Johnson-Jungle Cruise, Central Intelligence; Kevin Hart-Night School, Central Intelligence; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, The Spy Who Dumped Me and John Krasinski-Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, A Quiet Place.This is an animated tale of pets taking over for the super heroes. Dwayne voices Krypto, Superman's pet dog, that has the same powers as Superman. John voices Superman. When Lex Luthor's pet guinea pig, voiced by Kate, gains powers from orange Kryptonite and takes out the Justice League, it's up to Dwayne to try and stop her. Fortunately, a dog, voiced by Kevin, and some other pets-a pig, turtle and squirrel-also gain powers in the same incident and team up with Dwayne to fight the good fight. There is a side story involving Dwayne's jealousy of the relationship between his owner and Lois Lane and each of the other pets correspond to a different hero-Kevin with Batman, the turtle with The Flash, the pig with Wonder Woman and the squirrel with Green Lantern. There is a scene right after the end credits start and one at the very end-that one involves another super hero and his pet. There are some good voice acting by other characters too-I liked Keanu Reeves as Batman-and it ends hinting at a sequel.It's rated PG for action, violence, language and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.I like super hero movies so of course, I would buy this one on DVD."
567,DC League of Super-Pets,9," The Secret lives of Pets gets mixed in the DC Universe:Krypto the super pet to the famous superhero Superman, suddenly finds himself in peril when Superman and the rest of the Justice League are kidnapped. Krypto and some recently superpowered animals must together has a team before time runs out.The animation is almost similar to The Incredibles to the point I would have like to see them do a cross over, still good animation though. Voices of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, John Krasinski, Natasha Lyonne, Vanessa Bayer, and Keanu Reeves to name a few are all good here, and fit there voice acting. I wonder if a sequel is in the works."

569,DC League of Super-Pets,8," I'm not so sure that a guinea pig could make anyone a . . .:. . . ""Super Pet."" I had Roscoe for a few months when I was nine or ten. While he was still small enough to fit into a hamster ball--we thought--he managed to roll away when no one was looking, break out of circular confinement and make a run for it. Unfortunately for him--and us--Roscoe's idea of Freedom apparently lay in exploring the duct work of our house. Dad noted the damp duct workings of my eyeballs, and caused several hundreds of dollars worth of damage futilely searching for Roscoe. About a week after Dad had had enough, a foul odor indicated that Roscoe had kicked the bucket in the air return enclosure below my absent big brother's room. Though DC LEAGUE OF SUPER-PETS appeared to be a moving picture, it brought back some sad memories for me."
570,DC League of Super-Pets,," Big laughs  big fun  and lots of heart  a poor man's Secret Life of Pets this is not.:DC Comics is not in the best of shape these days - Warner Bros. Has mismanaged many properties released under the popular publication in recent memory be it on page, on the small screen, on the big screen, and in video games. Most of the content produced is either miss or average at best, with successes being isolated incidents. DC League of Super-Pets, I am happy to say, is a win for DC and Warner Bros. Respectively. Not only is it a good film in its own right, but it is also the closest to presenting its cast of character in a traditional and iconic fashioned - Superman feels like Superman, Wonder Woman feels like Wonder Woman, The Flash feels like The Flash, Cyborg feels like Cyborg, Batman feels like Batman, even though the material is very kid friendly with a more comedic tone. Aquaman feels like...Okay, not really, but still not a bad interpretation.The titular characters see decent modernization and work effectively into the narrative, newer additions such as PB (Wonder Woman's new animal sidekick) and Lulu (Lex Luthor's lab guinea pig) make equally as good an impression and are fairly entertaining to watch.Voice acting all around is super, Johnson and Hart continue to illustrate that they have rock solid chemistry, Vanessa Bayer, Natasha Lyonne, and Diego Luna are a riot, and Kate McKinnon is having too much fun as her villainous guinea pig.This movie is a good introduction for a kid wanting to get into the DC universe, and there are plenty of nice Easter Eggs that the parents will appreciate. It is not a great film, but unlike more recent DC output this is something kids and adults can enjoy alike."
571,DC League of Super-Pets,8," Fun film and a great time!:I had such a great time watching this movie. It was fun, full of great nods to things in and around the DC Universe. The characters were likable and well thought out! Kids will love it, parents will enjoy it!"
572,DC League of Super-Pets,8," Fun for adults as well as kids!:DC League of Super-Pets: Great fun as Superdog, Krypto (Dwayne Johnson) gets jealous when Superman's romance with Lois Lane gets more serious. Meanwhile Lex Luther is plotting to bring orange Kryptonite to Earth. Superman is snatched by Lex, while Krypto loses his powers. But animals in a pet store gain powers from the orange Kryptonite! They team up with Krypto to fight the forces of evil. One of them, a crazed hairless guinea pig, Lulu (Kate McKinnon) goes over to the Dark Side and lets loose an army of enhanced guinea pigs. Great battles and fun antics in this 3D computer-animated superhero action-comedy film. Mainly for kids but 5 of us (adults) went to see it and we were the only ones to stay to the end of the credits to see the teaser! Directed & Co-Written by Jared Stern. 8/10."
573,DC League of Super-Pets,10," Superheroes all going to the dogs!!!:Very inspirational and moralistic for a modern superhero film that ""goes to the dogs"" to save their own families!!! Krypto the Superdog leads his own teams of super powered animals to truth and justice, even with some of their animalistic instincts!"
574,DC League of Super-Pets,10," So much love for Super-Pets!!!:This movie brought so much love and joy and also lots of comedy for the whole family! Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are super great comedy duos with there amazing performances! Dwayne Johnson brought the best voice of: Krypto the Superdog, and Kevin Hart also brought the voice of: Ace the Hound with best comedy talents. I totally recommend watching DC's League of Super-Pets on the big screen possible!"
575,Eternals,3," Dire.:I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.Almost two and a half hours long, and every single minute of this film was an effort. How on Earth did they think this would appeal?It's a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.Special effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn't.I love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn't halt either career.I don't think a second will follow somehow.Awful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it's a shocker, 3/10."
576,Eternals,4," Watching this movie felt like an eternity:Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer."
577,Eternals,3," Fairly shallow Marvel experience...:Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.And that was the case with the 2021 movie ""Eternals"" from writers Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. This movie was all flash and bang and no proper contents. It was all essentially just pointless eye-candy.For me, then we are talking about a swing and a miss for Marvel Studios with the 2021 superhero movie ""Eternals"". When the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'what did I just waste two and a half hours on watching?'. And I was also left with a sense of none of the characters portrayed in the story had any significance or backstory. You might as well replace them with mannequins and still end up with the same movie result.You would assume that with a cast ensemble that included the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Lauren Ridloff among others, that you would be in for a stellar movie experience. But nay, director Chloé Zhao didn't rise to the occasion to deliver a wholesome and entertaining superhero movie. Nope, this was a lukewarm movie at best.The total absence of properly written characters and character development throughout the two and a half hours of runtime was just atrocious to witness. And it totally turned the movie into a shallow experience. Yet, I managed to sit through it, but believe you me, this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to watch a second time. There were so many characters to keep track off, yet none of them had any properly written backstory, character traits, personalities or anything, so they just sort of blended into one singular faceless mass. And hence, I didn't care one bit about any of the hero characters, because they were about as interesting as mannequins.""Eternals"" was pure and simply just eye-candy in term of entertainment value. The storyline would have been more interesting if the story had interesting characters, subplots, etc., but there was no such thing going on here.Sure, I am by no account a fan of the superhero genre, but watch the movie regardless, but ""Eternals"" was definitely among the top contenders for being among the most pointless and boring of superhero movies.My rating of ""Eternals"" lands on a three out of ten stars."
578,Eternals,5," hard to connect:The Eternals are immortals created to eliminate the destructive Deviants. 7000 years ago, ten Eternals were sent to Earth. They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.This is a reach for the MCU franchise. I like the audacity but there are issues with the execution. I do like the style and the visual but I find the characters hard to connect with. They are god-like creatures trying to pass as humans. There is something compelling in that but the characters never fully find their human level. There is barrier to these characters that the film is unable to breach. In addition, Angelina Jolie is too distracting in this role. I like Gemma Chan but maybe she should play Thena. Sersi needs an ingenue with star power. In the end, this is a tougher premise to execute than most and the film struggles to give it a human scale."
579,Eternals,5," Eternal was the Runtime:I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute."
580,Eternals,2," Definitely my #1 Worst Movie of the Year!:Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal. So where's the logic. This movie was completely overrated i'm sorry. This film was the worst mcu film. So boring and the plot was all over the place."
581,Eternals,," Neither Intrigues Nor Entertains:The 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the arrival of a new brand of superheroes into their ever-growing family and further expands the horizons of its shared universe with its grand scope. However, being one of the lesser-known properties the way Guardians was back in 2014, Eternals needed to create an intrigue & curiosity to make us care & invest in its mythic world but the film as a whole simply falls flat at it.Co-written & directed by Chloé Zhao (The Rider & Nomadland), her latest effort opts for a slightly different path that at times avoids or escapes the familiar trappings of a standard Marvel fare but then its attempts to forge its own identity is executed with such blandness that there is no life to it. The film is devoid of the fun & fascinating qualities of its studio's finest works and neither its storytelling nor its ensemble compel us enough to give a damn.It is an ambitious undertaking no doubt that intends to explore a few interesting ideas but Zhao goes for it without working out the fundamentals first. She aims for the intimacy with surface-level digging into these superpowered beings but with there being no incentive for us to even bother, the emotions & warmth don't shine through. Add to that, the story is needlessly overlong, tediously paced, and is filled with characters without camaraderie with one another.Overall, Eternals is a dull, lifeless & forgettable addition to Marvel Studios canon and also happens to be one of their rarest gambles that doesn't pay off the desired dividends. While the diverse ensemble is a welcome move from the inclusivity standpoint, the actors are more or less wasted in their roles and aren't given anything interesting to leave their imprint upon. It remains to be seen how this chapter plays out in Marvel's Phase 4 plan but as a standalone entry, Eternals is mediocre at best."
582,Eternals,5," i'm so sad:I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie.Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I'm curious to see more from most of the characters.This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening night 11/4/2021, 11/17/2021)"
583,Eternals,1," Horrible:Trying to be ""deep"", the director uses some long shots (or longer than usual in the MCU) here and there, less frenetic editing here and there, and less Marvel humor (there is enough though), in a thing that turned to be a really, really bad experiment. Valient effort though?In the end, none of that matters that much because the biggest problems with the movie are the simple things: way too many characters, all flat and not particularly interesting (maybe because there is not time to develop them); the interpretations from the important ones, the leads, robotic and soulless; the story told in unnecessary back and forth, maybe as an attempt to make it seem more complex than it was, and not letting the movie to get into any rhythm; and finally, contrary to what I read a lot, the special effects and the desings of the powers and suits and the actions scenes, all just bad, simple or with awful CGI (or a combination of those).Other than that, it was great(?)"
584,Eternals,2," It just feels like an unnecessary movie:The whole plot was terrible . They focused all the attention for almost 2 hours on the deviance and all of a sudden it turns out they're not the bad guys after all let's focus 30 minutes of the rest of the movie on someone else.. Marvel failed a great cast with a terrible script. Marvel should separate Eternals film into 2 Parts to have more progressive storyline and deep dive on characterization and the build up of motivation to save the Earth with balanced action sequences and dramas in between... Eternals Book 1 and Eternals Book 2. Just like what Warner did on Dune film.. or Avengers 3 and 4. Worst movie I've seen in years!!!! Worst MCU movie. Hardly any character development, no reason to care about the characters. Outside if him, the comedy was lackluster. Pace was off. Most performances by the actors were good but their stories were not deep enough, hard to do with that many protagonists in one movie. My first thought was why do the people already have british and scottish accent even before they arrive on earth? Like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive on Earth but when they later end up separating and going their own ways they end up developing their british and scottish accent or whatever. Maybe I'm nitpicking it too much but it was literally the first scene in the movie that just broke my immersion immediately."
585,Eternals,4," Watching people who mostly can't die (eternals) fight each other can be boring:This review has been declined 3 times now. I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.The whole film was pretty flat, John Snow turned up and said some funny lines, and Gemma Chan was lovely to look at, but there sure was a lot of cheese in this vegan meal of a film. Some terrible 'inspirational' life messages delivered direct to camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric.It played like it was constructed from a ""making big budget films for dummies"" book, and they left it at pretty much the bullet points list on the inside cover.Shoehorn in a Diversity cast that differed greatly from the source material. I do like to see diversity on screen but sometimes it appears over zealous, like this film and comes across as forced and token and works against the world of the film. The Eternals are not from earth at all so no need to tick all the diversity check boxes. Quite the opposite, they should appear with no cultural links at all. They also shoe horned in a sign language eternal, which just made no sense in the world of the Eternals, Why would the massively powerful universe creators create an eternal who couldn't hear or speak and needed to use their hands to communicate? The original comics had Makkari as a Male who has a relationship with Sersi, in fact many of the original Eternals are male. I'm all for positive representations on a diverse society, but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as the film's story was concerned.Slot in an ex boy band debut as an actor - Check!My eyes rolled back into my head when that happened. Big budget movie making by the numbers.I don't know quite where the problem was. Chloé Zhao's direction by committee choices? It wasn't all bad, there was some decent acting, particularly Barry Keoghan who's character seemed complex, but,... even so it was roped in and never went anywhere. Gilgamesh also was good, until he was dispatched easily.Then they started fighting each other, and they're Eternals and can't die, except when it's convenient to move the plot along. It got boring really quickly."
586,Eternals,4," Definitely the MCU's weakest movie:Eternals had the potential to be a real standout film from the crowd, but it missed out on breaking ranks from its franchise's long-held cliches like 'action scene then funny one-liner' moments that don't feel like character moments anymore, but 'creative mandates' imposed by the studio.It's a BIG movie, so big that it's got too many stories for it's single-movie outline and all these brand-spanking-new characters who desperately needed more character development outside Eternal's 2 and ½ hour runtime. This movie is a 'beautifully made mess': and it's bound to be 'retconned' with a throwaway line of dialogue (or with some jokes) in one of the next Avengers movies like Thor 2 was in Ragnarok.Eternals gets 2/5 stars. It tries to stand out, but it's ultimately more of the same."
587,Eternals,," Eternals boring just like the Inhumans:A couple of years ago, there was The Inhumans mini-series, featuring superheroes who lived on the Moon, but were supposedly protecting Earth. Now the Eternals are doing the same thing, with a similar cast of superheroes.Too many sets of protectors, too many lame superheroes with similar powers, too much boring back-story, just too much."
588,Eternals,2," Most boring supers ever:I can understand Marvel wanting to expand its universe; all you have to do is look at the dollars to understand it. But, the thing about superheroes, they have to be super beyond their powers. I didn't know anything about these characters and frankly after watching this movie I don't want to know anymore. I thought Justice league and Batman versus Superman were bad. But nothing has been as boring as this movie. It's cheesy and preachy with no interesting characters except Sprite and the Deviant. I think they may need to stop cause superhero overload can cause bad movie making decisions."
589,Eternals,2," Worst MCU film ever:Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.This film is by far the worst MCU film I have watch. It's massive insuylt to the comics from the Jack Kirby days. Gender swapping some of the eternals, bad story telling which makes absolutely no sense, unlikeable characters, little to no action and ridicules changes to the MCU just sum up how bad this film. Completely ruined EndgameThe only goods were the music and the CGI for Arishen as well as bonus points for being voiced by David Kaye.Other then that it's just not a good movie makes both Captain Marvel and Iron Man 3 look good."
590,Eternals,4," one boring trip  I stopped after one hour:And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but......after one hour I turned this off. On part of the effects it all looked great but what the hell about the story and characters. It's all one boring mess. Nothing happens and when things happens I was thinking, okay, is this it? Fighting against CGI creatures. Not that I have a thing against CGI creatures but it was all lame.The beginning was okay with the history of the world but then it just became one boring love story and as one said, a lifeless flick.How much I tried, It won't stick for eternal in my mind.Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 4/5
Story 2/5
Comedy 0/5."
591,Eternals,6," Magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters:Chloé Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters."
592,Eternals,4," Long drawn out superhero film that spans time and ages!:Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive."
593,Eternals,4," Hope This Timeline Isn't Eternal:This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.Overall, it's absolutely not the worst MCU movie, but it fits nowhere in the top half best. Since it's barely, like 1%, connected to the other MCU movies, it could be a skip for sure."
594,Eternals,2," Easily one of the worst movies I've seen this year tbh:I am not really impressed this Eternals movie .. looks like amature superpower. Boring fight scenes & not really advantures . Well, overall it still can be watch to the end of this movie . 4/10. This film is actually not fiction at all. Worst film ever it's unbelievably terrible. Im shocked how marvel made this crap, bad acting and even worse story line . Powers are as if a school kid thought them up. Pissed !!! Do not waste your money buying it. That was the most boring Marvel movie ive ever watched! The entire movie is huge plot hole. So Celestials need to seed intelligent life to birth their kind but stood by somehow as Thanos wiped out half of life, then came back to completely wipe out the other half and all of existence? I really want to like this movie but it just didn't really work for me. Really feel like this needed to be a miniseries or spread out across multiple movies. Just too much stuff crammed into a 2 hour period. Didn't give me enough time to care about the characters/story that much, and the wonky pacing and acting didn't help with that either. I don't hate the movie, but could've been so much better."
595,Eternals,2," Won't watch again:This movie felt like 3 movies supercut into one. Pacing was all over the place. Seems a stretch for me to call most of these characters ""super-heroes,"" most seemed remarkably pathetic in their abilities, some of these ""Eternals"" were so easily killed, yet some inexplicably were tanks. Humor was very weak; the best lines were from the trailer and most of those were cringey. Kit Harrington was wasted. Angelina Jolie was wasted. All the major plot points were just exposition vomit or were so obviously telegraphed. I was never so conflicted in a post-credit scene. On one hand I was grateful for this dreadful movie to be over, and then sacked with absolute apathy that the Eternals ""will return...."" I hope not. I was just so so disappointed, wanted to cry this movie frustrates me sm, lore was thrown out the window, it didnt even seem like the eternals (besides the fast girl) could even fight. I was looking forward for this movie to demonstrate how this era of marvel movies is supposed to be on such a vast scale, no longer being about earth alone but the multiverses."
596,Eternals,2," Another marmite movie from Disney:Some will love it some will hate it, whichever category you're in you're lying out your back teeth saying this is either the worst or best MCU movie, at best this movie is a 5, at its worst its a 2,I've opted for the latter simply because this movie fails at pretty much everything it attempts:
story; lacklustre.Characters; dull.Action; mediocre.Had I not known I was watching a Disney /Marvel movie I would have believed this was another DC catastrophe, the characters looked more like DCs ""New Gods"" than Marvels ""Eternals"", perhaps the director got them mixed up as both properties were created, written & drawn by the late great Jack Kirby, a master storyteller, which Chloe Zhao definitely is not.Zhao was given full authority over the Eternals production & took it on herself to completely re-write the screenplay which is probably why the movie was as dull as it ended up being.Very little of the movie follows the original comic creation, from characters to storyline, Kirby created a complex story that would have probably been too much to adapt into a single movie & probably judged as too ""comic bookish"", Zhao has literally skimmed the surface of Kirbys work & chosen a more simplistic re-write of the Eternals, both story & characters.Boasting a budget of $200 million dollars, standard for today's so called ""blockbusters"", there is no reason for the movie to have anything but top notch cgi & effects, fantastic sets & breathtaking cinematography, which this movie has but the action scenes are dull, fantastically detailed but ultimately boring & that is also the case with all the characters, dull & dreary, Kirby wrote these characters as super human heroes with multiple fantastical abilitys & impossible to kill hence the name ""Eternals"", Zhao unpicks Kirbys creation in nonsensical fashion, stripping the characters abilities to a single defining one for each character.In Zhaos story the Eternals have been on earth for 7 thousand years, in this time, suffering barely a scratch then 2 die in the silliest most easy way possible,while then showing another being intensely & brutally beaten & battered but barely scratched or bruised, utter tripe.Zhao took Kirbys creation and used it for her own ends, diversity & inclusion, Eternals spends more time parading its diverse cast in their silly shiny costumes than telling an entertaining & imaginative story.If this is what's to come in future phases from Disney/Marvel then Marvels future is definitely on the downhill run."
597,Eternals,4," A bit too... much.:The Eternals tries breaking MCU ranks whilst suffering from sequel-teasing and not enough narrative breathing room to let the screenplay really shine through the film's many inconsistencies (be it Icarus' arc and the logic of the alien-super-race as the antagonists). This film claims to be more diverse than the rest of the canon, but it's more of the same action-then-punchline stuff some weary viewers just can't shake off any longer. The formula's starting to show its cracks and can't be used to introduce characters for uninitiated viewers like they did with The Avengers or Spider-Man (characters we now have collective knowledge on).The action's nice and big, but the characters don't change, the story feels like it needs 6-7 movies to play out properly, and the in-world logic kind of clashes with everything that happened before (these space-Gods can change little human conflicts in Mesopotamia' but not stop the Snap, Hiroshima or 9/11 because 'natural progress'). So yeah: the spectacle was nice but it didn't make up for the story being an overcooked yet wanting for further development outside of a lone 2 and ½ hour movie introducing too many characters all at once.Eternals: doesn't feel like it's gonna have everlasting appeal in spite of the title. 2/5 stars."
598,Eternals,4," Possibly the ""worst"" MCU film.:Okay, bear with me since this will be a difficult review. I don't particularly think this was ruined by too many characters as Endgame had 31+ characters, but suffered from poor pacing, runtime, and the lack of character development. I have to say that I did not enjoy this film as I am not into mythology stuff. The first and second acts were painfully boring with a bit decent third act. Ajak was given nothing to her character. Sersi. I almost have no idea what to say about her, but her personality should have been interesting. For Ikaris, I was not interested in the romance between him and Sersi. The sex scene wasn't needed at all, although I am surprised that have gotten away from that in a PG-13 movie. He does have a few fun scenes where he speculates a table to be made out of vibranium, slams it which turned out it isn't. ""I don't wear a cape."" Kingo was a decent and fun character that I mostly enjoyed throughout the movie. He had an interesting character setting where he has a fondness for movies and modern technology as he is a famous Bollywood movie star, dancer, and director who has fun with humans. Karun was also a fun presence with great chemistry with Kingo. The stuff about him and filming a documentary was hilarious. For Sprite. Oh my god. I think she has to be my least favorite character in this movie, there isn't anything interesting about her, and she always whines. Phastos was not bad, but a decent character. I have to say that the 1945 scene was mentally heartbreaking commenting on how advancing technology can have brutal consequences. Druig. I do have big mixed feelings about him. He does somewhat have a character arc where he doesn't want the humans to have a conflict so he uses his powers to stop them, but is stopped by the group. Eventually, in the third act, he learns to not interfere with conflicts, but still, I don't like him either way. Makkari wasn't annoying like the others as she has a likable personality, lack of ability to speak. She's fun and has a great dynamic with the team. Also, I liked how they treated her speed ability. Thena does actually have somewhat of an interesting character arc where she can have episodes that make her go rogue against the team which leads her to go with Gilgamesh in order to make anything to not go worse. The scenes of her fighting with her weapons are quite entertaining. Overall, this is just meh.4/10."
599,Eternals,," Spectacular visuals  but:The visuals of ""Eternals"" are spectacular. They look very real and very stylish. I also applaud the film for the diversity of the cast. However, the build up of the film is just too slow and too long, and I lost most of my interest and concentration when the final showdown begins. In addition, the one liner jokes are a little out of place and quite contrived. It is still an entertaining film, but probably not as great as the recent Marvel films."
600,Tenet,5," Over-complicated  way too long  and not all that exciting.:Those who liked 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Those who hated 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Having read so many contradicting reviews about 'Tenet' I decided to watch it for myself to make up my own mind.I tried so hard to understand the film by carefully listening to the dialogue and observing every inch of detail. However, I found myself lost ever so often. The quick-cut editing and fast-spoken dialogue made it all the more difficult to follow.'Tenet' is trying so hard to take time travel to the next level. Did they succeed? I suppose that would depend on your views of the film. It sure as hell confused the audience. And who enjoy watching confusing movies? And if your audience is still lost an hour into the movie, there's something wrong with the narration... or Nolan is just such a genius that our puny minds can't comprehend his vision and understanding.Nevertheless, I decided to stuck it out and kept watching. The final our started making sense, and the action sequences were good (nothing mind blowing, though). Once I understood the concept of inverted entropy (not only moving back in time, but also backwards in time), it was easier to follow. It was still way over-complicated.Another big issue for me, was the film's lead: John David Washington, who starred as Protagonist (seriously, Christopher Nolan, you couldn't give your protagonist a name other than Protagonist????). He lacked emotion and for most parts looked either tired or lazy. There was very little enthusiasm from him as an actor. He certainly did NOT make a likable or credible hero. Maybe he himself was so confused that he didn't know what the hell he was doing and concentrated too hard on saying all those confusing lines.The visuals were interesting in the beginning, but during the final act it simply looked like a film that was playing in reverse. In closing, 'Tenet' is not a movie I can recommend. If you want to watch it to see what the hype was all about, then go ahead. But there are far better and easier to understand action movies out there. And to sit through this for two and a half hours is exhausting.Christopher Nolan's 2000 movie 'Memento' was far better. This was also an interesting concept where the story was moving back in time, but at the same time moving forward."
601,Tenet,5," Far too clever for its own good:Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...Christopher Nolan's latest follows Inception and interstellar and, if you thought they were difficult to understand and follow, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Inversion is a great maguffin. The problem here is that in order to follow the story, you need to have an understanding of how inversion works, and that's exactly what you don't get here. In fact a lady scientist early on says ""Don't try to understand it, just accept it,"" and this is effectively writer/director talking to the viewer. I think this is code for him saying ""I haven't really thought this through completely, so don't expect it to make sense."" Given that it has taken him years to write this...There are various problems. Given that you have time running backwards and forwards at the same time, it's fair to generate an element of ""What's going on?"" to be answered when a reverse-time sequence unfolds in positive time back to its start at the end. But what I just said gives some indication of how preplexing the film is when much of it is told that way. A number of IMDB reviews say it was gibberish on first viewing, made sense on second viewing. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to see a film twice for it to make sense, especially if it takes a frustrating two and a half hours to watch it once.The next problem is that dialogue is mumbled and buried under general noise, making it nearly impossible to hear very necessary exposition.I'm not going to go on about this film which would have been a great deal better if it had been a great deal simpler, and which would have benefitted from Nolan having a co-writer on board to act as the viewer's friend. This film is NOT the greatest thing since sliced bread. I give it 5 out of 10, which is what happens when a 10/10 positive entropy maguffin meets an inversed 0/10 script."
602,Tenet,7," Tenet Review:Clémence Poésy character says in the film ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" And later Pattinson character ask to the main character ""Does your head hurt yet?"" While he is trying to explain part of the plot to The Protagonist and to us as an audience, this is basically the whole movie, visually is great, the score even being loud is also great, the concept of moving backwards is also a great idea that give a lot great scenes, but when you stop to realize, a lot of things don't make a lot of sense."
603,Tenet,," Interesting concept  good story  could have been told a lot better.:Many reviewers say you have to watch this movie multiple times to really get it all. No, I won't do that. I say a good movie is understandable with one viewing where the viewer is paying attention.This is a relatively simple story, told in a complex manner with lots of special effects and aggressive sound track. Our future civilization has figured a way to interact with the past and now, in our PRESENT they intend to correct a problem we caused them, and if necessary destroy the world as we know it. So the PRESENT day leaders have to prevent that.My wife and I watched it on a 2-disc DVD set from our public library. Much of the dialog is difficult to understand because the actors often fail to enunciate, so I had to turn on subtitles about half-way through. The second DVD is filled with extras.It is a pretty good, entertaining movie, but often very confusing. I would not put it in the top tier of favorite movies. Nolan's ""Inception"" for example is a much better movie."
604,Tenet,9," If you are into movies  Tenet is your jam.:If you want to enjoy an intriguing and interesting film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, then TENET is a great choice.My IMAX experience:
A bit of a headache at start but 20min later the headache gets bigger. About 1 hour in the film, it turns into a migraine. And about 1h 45m in, the head explodes!So... I had to go again and watch it.The 2nd time was very rewarding. No headache and i could see through many details and respect the effort making this film.Overall, this is an outstanding filmmaking effort by Nolan and Co. There is almost no green screen mambo-jumbo, real stunts are a fact and you can enjoy a plot which will keep you thinking what the hell is happening at 50% of the film. Rewatching is also fun; I had the pleasure to watch it in IMAX twice (it's all shot in IMAX cameras btw).Kudos to the score, it really coated the action and the entire film in a fantastic way, keeping pace at all times.I don't think I have seen something similar before in terms of non-linear filmmaking and although I was very confused at start, I got into it halfway through and that was very rewarding.Now I guess many of you are still confused.I was too. But once you figure it out, it all makes sense. Except some nonsense.9/10, good solid film."
605,Tenet,4," Momento was a cry for help ...:Nobody listened. This was the result. Sure, we get it, when some viewers make that special effort to ""understand"" the mad genius of the film-maker. Makes them feel special. But here is a tip from a member with 1600+ reviews. Like Seinfeld once said, if you choose your detergent based on its ability to remove bloodstains, you have bigger problems than laundry. If you need to watch the film several times, preferably with subtitles (quoting from one of the top rated reviews here), you are not here for the movie. Or the bear hunting."
606,Tenet,1," I'm Pretty Stupid but This Managed to Totally Insult My Intelligence:How can I go backwards in time to where I started watching this movie and convince myself to watch an episode of ""Golden Girls"" instead?A lot of people say this movie makes sense if you watch it again. Why would anyone watch this movie twice?How does anyone tell these big-budget action apart? They all work under the premise that violence and gun-play are synonymous with quality, as in the more of them the better. They all have some huge and diabolical plot where the protagonist is ""fighting for the survival of the entire world.""We have to talk about the sound mixing in this mess. If I didn't have subtitles, I would have never understood about twenty-five percent of the dialogue. At what point does dramatic music (is it music?) become very undramatic and annoying? If you've ever wondered about that, all your answers can be found here.There is no real plot to this, it's just action scenes cobbled together, none of which really have much to do with the other.Why does he care so much about the wife of a Russian oligarch? ""Leave her alone,"" he cries at one point. It makes no sense at all the risks he takes to pull her irons out of the fire.$200 million budget. Imagine how many good movies they could have made for this sum."
607,Tenet,1," Pretentious action movie:If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks."
608,Tenet,5," Lots of potential  but chaotic and at tee end  unsatisfying:I am a big Nolan and Sci-Fi fan, and there's no question serious effort went into this movie. No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic ""Tenet"" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task. The one word that sticks in my mind about this movie is disappointing. After the long delay, i really expected something a lot better than this. Maybe a later edit will fix this, but it certainly doesn't need to get any longer."
609,Tenet,7," Not as good as it thinks it is:Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come."
610,Tenet,6," First real disappointment from Mr. Christopher Nolan:Greetings from Lithuania.I just came back from a premiere of ""Tenet"" (2020), a hugely anticipated new movie by Mr. Christopher Nolan - my favorite director. I'm a huge Nolan's fan, saw all his movie in a theater and they all left me speechless and i even consider ""Interstellar"" as my favorite film of this millennium - i'm a real Nolan's fan boy.And with my broken heart i can only say after seeing ""Tenet"" that it was a first real disappointment by this brilliant director. This time Mr. Nolan has outdone himself, and not in a good way. Story and plot were a mess. Its not ""Inception"" by any means - that movie had a very simple idea and plot which was put into this intriguing world and concept - it wasn't difficult to follow because you always knew exactly what was the goal, who is who and etc. ""Tenet"" does not had any of that. While i enjoyed the plot for a around first 40% of its run time, later its just become so convoluted that farther it went the more i was scratching my head and eventually started to rolling my eyes when Robert Pattinson's and John David Washington's characters were describing the plot to each other, jumping for and between, reading between the lines and etc - it was simply way to complicated and eventually convoluted. By the end of this movie i really didn't care what was going on nor did i tried to understand - the movie's plot and storytelling lost me completely. Its not Nolan ""the director"" who wasn't good here, but its Noland ""the screenwriter"" who i think overdone himself this time, and not in a good way. The good things in this movie were for me performance by Kenneth Branagh who was excellent villain, cinematography and basically all the production values in this movie - they are first rate. Unfortunately plot and storytelling were below average - they just didn't for me at all.Overall, unfortunately the year 2020 was a terrible year not only because of the virus, but also it was a year when we got a first flop from Mr. Nolan. Its not that its a bad movie, like i said production values are first rate but other then that you will be scratching your head in disbelieve of how convoluted and cold this movie is. For his next feature Mr. Nolan should slow it down with plot and maybe take his brother as writer to help - together they can put plots and screenplays like no other. ""Tenet"" unfortunately is not the case."
611,Tenet,5," Another Overrated Mess by Christopher Nolan:""Tenet"" is another overrated mess by Christopher Nolan, who is a Hollywood's darling. The story seems to be written under influence, in a confused screenplay. The action and mainly the special effects are top notch. But Denzel Wahington's son is not adequate for the role of super-spy and the plot is a complete mess hard to be followed. ""Tenet"" is adequate for Nolan's worshipers that do not have prejudice to paradoxes and confused stories, and for pseudo-intellectuals that do not fully understand the plot and are ashamed to confess. Do not waste your time watching this long mess if you are not in the previous categories. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Tenet"""
612,Tenet,4," I did not like it a lot  Nolan seems to be on a downward spiral for me now:""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind.Then again, Nolan's films are almost always more about the magic of the story and the scientific aspect partially even, the other production values too, and not necessarily about really deep and meaningful characters. It is the case here again. Robert Pattinson is another good example. I definitely think he received a lot of unfair criticism for Twilight and he has been (unlike Lautner) in several good films in the last decade since these vampire films and given strong performances too. He is definitely an option for an Oscar nomination in the near future. But for this film here he felt almost completely wasted. I mean he had a lot of screen time, but barely any significance. The one who stood out a bit in terms of performances here was Kenneth Branagh showing us that he can play a Russian brute very well too. Talented actor and filmmaker without a doubt and his rough take on the role made his relationship with Debicki's character the most interesting component of the entire film perhaps. Debicki did what she had to do I would say, but she never really stood out either. Oh yes, Nolan regular Michael Caine, who is closing in on 90, gets his one scene as well again basically talking to the protagonist relatively early on just like it was the case with ""Inception"" too for him. No material to shine at all though. That's pretty much it with the cast. More familiar faces and names too for sure, but nobody really outstanding.As for the story, you are thrown right in the middle of it all with the concert hall scene. It is tense and brutal, but for me it was too fast and I would have preferred a little more introduction and explanation here. Let's be honest. If you did not know who the protagonist was, simply because JDW is kinda famous (like him or not), it would have felt even more pointless. The idea of the suicide pill being just a test is an interesting one though and also kinda makes sense that it was all staged because, let's be honest, the ""bad guys"" must be utter fools to let such a severely suffering prisoner give his pill to another one caught by them. Still, this was to me the first moment and inclusion that felt good. A lot of the story about travelling back in time, like literally physically back in time felt not depicted in a way where it convinced me. If we are gentle, we could say that Nolan's mind is still too great to make sense to general audiences, but if not, we could also say that his idea here was not good and interesting enough and more for the sake of being genius than actually being genius and that also a lot got lost in translation. I did like the really simple introduction scene to the concept though at the shooting range between the scientist and the protagonist. This was nice. But when they extended this concept to humans and a plot that is about saving the world, then it did not win me over unfortunately. Oh well, like I said, maybe I need to watch it again.Also the final moment between Washington's and Pattinson's characters where we find out they knew each other for a lot longer did not make much of an impact to me. At least not as much as I hoped because this beautiful friendship was supposed to be shown as one of the more emotional twists this film has to offer. I would say that judging from the absense of audible reactions from the crowd during my showing that most others were not really that impressed either. Or maybe I am being too harsh here and really need to rewatch to see if the one reviewer on the front page here is correct by saying that it feels like nothing special on the first viewing, but pretty great on rewatch. Still not motivated though and besides, I rarely tend to appreciate a movie more on television or a small screen than at a movie theater and I will definitely not go again as long as it is shown right now. The only reason that could kinda get me to would be Branagh's performance. Here Nolan proves again for me that he may not really be the best when it comes to truly emotional aspects away from action sequences. I am mostly talking about the talk referring to the female protagonist's son. Like when we hear from one character the world will be destroyed and then Debicki's character says something like that would mean her son dies too. A bit on the cringe side.I am kinda glad they did not elaborate more on a potential romance relationship between her and JDW's character because then things could have gotten really messy. The one scene with the talk about Branagh's antagonist character thinking they could have sex was enough already. Speaking of him, he also talks on one occasion about holes in the neck and what to fill them with. Okay, that was rough. And almost a bit of cult like from a Tarantino movie (where we indirectly could have seen it depicted on the screen even). I won't deny it. Rough, but entertaining. What you think about the terminal disease plot that got revealed later on and as a consequence about Branagh's character developing some kind of god complex is up to you. I thought it was right, but like I said, I believed almost everything about Branagh's character and performance here. It's okay if you think it was too much. The one thing I would not be okay with though is really people saying that this was a magnificent movie or (one of) Nolan's best. I thought it was too much on the underwhelming side for a positive recommendation even and I genuinely hope that the filmmaker can improve again with his upcoming projects. I mean he may have another 30 years in the industry and I refuse to believe that ""Tenet"" (spelled Tenet backwards too, definitely not a coincidence) and ""Dunkirk"" will be on the same level as everything he has coming up in the future or at least I don't want to believe. No need to challenge your audience this much, Chris, sometimes less is more. How about an animated movie for once?"
613,Tenet,6," Tenet:There are elements of Christopher Nolan's Tenet that has been inspired by other sources. 12 Monkeys, La Jetée, The Red Dwarf episode called Backwards, Steven Moffat's Doctor Who stories featuring River Song.Stripped of its gimmick of inverted time. It is basically John Le Carre's The Night Manager. Elizabeth Debicki appeared in the television adaptation and basically plays a similar character in Tenet.The Protagonist (John David Washington) teams up with sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson) to stop Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) who has found a way to send a destructive weapon back from the future.In this temporal war, the Protagonist needs to get to Sator via his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki.)The inverted backward effects are eye dazzlingly conveyed. Nolan once again goes for an expensive high concept James Bond type set pieces.However the various going ons in the story is confusing. Not helped by terms such as Time Inversion, Temporal Pincer movement. I found the trick is to follow the forward narrative of Neil and not be confused by the The Protagonist's stories.Tenet is an enjoyable funfair ride. However I also felt that it was something you would quickly forget as you do not want to spend a lot of time thinking about it. I have no doubts that I would watch it again at a later date.Due to Covid 19, the cinema I saw it at was almost empty and I watched it on a weekend. That did somewhat rob the atmosphere."
614,Tenet,2," No story...no characters...no movie:This is the first movie I have legitimately HATED in quite some time. The 2 and a half hour bore fest has almost zero winning elements. It's got a very effective music score. Outside of that, the movie has a couple of MILDLY amusing combat scenes occurring in reverse, as advertised, and one impressive death scene. That aside, what does Tenet really consist of?To me, it feels like Christopher Nolan decided that this film's schtick would simply be featuring a lot of reverse action footage - and that would make it stand out enough to win people over. Well, it did work in the sense that seeing it in trailers did at least pique a lot of interest. But, somehow he thought that his asinine plot would somehow validate all the reverse footage enough to keep it intriguing, and sellable? Absolutely not.By the time you're 45 minutes into the movie you realize you're simply caught in someone's really bad idea that just doesn't work. So, how can the film cover all this up? Apparently by giving the movie as big of a cast as possible, and making sure that each cast member is from a different part of the world, in order to make the movie feel more worldly, and thus by default, more sophisticated. Then, we consistently place these characters in the largest, most obscure vehicles or machines that we can possibly get our hands on, in situations that physically present very high stakes, but otherwise leaves the viewer asking ""wait, why are they here though? Like, why are they doing this right now?"", and then blow up as much stuff as possible. EXPLOSIONS, MAN. But, none of it works - no matter how big the boat is, or how big the explosion is, no one's going to care or feel a thing if the plot and the film's characters are so insanely vapid. And that is precisely the case here.I recall a lot of people complaining about the audio in this movie, that they ""couldn't hear what they were saying"". I honestly believe that's because the dialogue is so useless, so void of all relativity & void of all humanity, that their brains were actually just blocking the information from being processed because it was such waste. Subconscious filters at work, if you will.I appreciate a good ambitious, original movie in this day and age, but holy lord, this is simply not cinema to me. It's a wank fest through and through. No story, no characters, no movie. It's gotta be my least favorite Christopher Nolan movie. Definitely my least favorite movie of 2020. I would say avoid at all costs."
615,Tenet,7," relentless filmmaking:The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a CIA operative. He is captured during an operation in Ukraine. He is able to eat a cyanide pill. He wakes up and gets recruited to fight a new cold war. Someone in the future is using inverted entropy to affect events in the past. He and Neil (Robert Pattinson) start investigating zeroing in on former Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and his abused wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).Christopher Nolan obviously has a thing about time. Memento happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. He is attacking it with all of his filmmaking skills and it is an attack from the editing, the sound mix, the plot, to the structure of the movie. First thing I noticed is that Nolan is relentlessly pushing the pace with every bit of filmmaking. The sound mix is like a heartbeat driving the movie whenever it goes into action mode. The editing is crisp and head-snapping. This is his transport plane deliberately driven into a constructed fake building. He's driving the movie into a fake building and not letting the audience the time to ruminate about the logic of the premise.In the end, that's its biggest flaw. The premise is out there and it's hard to keep track of the plot after the turn. The first part is a movie of one thing after another. When it gets to Kat, it finally tries to establish a connection with the characters. The fun part is the backward action moves but the logic of this premise keeps bugging me. For example, why is he trying to shoot himself in the past? Thinking about it after the fact leaves one with more questions and questions about the questions. The good part is that the relentless great action makes it impossible to dislike. The backwards action is just fun and different. That's plenty good enough."
616,Tenet,5," Unnecessarily complicated  way too long. Very disappointed considering all the hype generated during last months:I had big expectations for Tenet, since I first watched the trailer. Instead, the movie is very confusing and maybe in order to understand it, I need to watch it more than once. I managed to follow halfway through it, but then I was completely lost. Except the main two characters Neil and The Protagonist, the rest of the cast is pretty flat and Kat is really annoying, especially towards the end. At least actors were good enough to maintain the whole thing afloat.From a technical perspective the movie is good, and there are a few good scenes here and there, but I would say that special effects were cheap and lazy. I mean, from a visionary director such as Nolan I wasn't expecting for sure a bunch of reversed clips. The ending had no sense at all and you cannot actually understand what is happening.If this is the movie that was supposed to relaunch cinemas, after the lockdown period, well, I suggest to look elsewhere. Tenet is unoriginal and uninspired, Nolan already made movies about space and time such as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", so I think that in this case he could have change the topic.A real pity. Movie's definitely too long and there are many stretched out sequences and useless story lines. Instead of deepening some details, which could actually make understand something about what's happening. I suggest to give it a try, but do not expect a masterpiece."
617,Tenet,7, Big fan of Nolan but this movie is a lost cause:Maybe the concept here is suppose to be great but with muddled dialogues and confusing chaotic story line still can't make sense of this. Some great action for sure.
618,Tenet,1," When Style is The Tenet !:Imagine that you are in a hall, and someone is giving a speech by a dead language, for 2 hours and a half. Sure I can conceive your level of provocation. But what if after translating what he was saying, you discovered that he was speaking gibberish? Now, I can't conceive your level of anger!I couldn't understand a thing from this movie. While it's 150 minutes long, I have at least 150 unanswered questions. Every second is unbearable, with rare kind of bore; the bore of watching a running corpse that speaks cryptically and acts absurdly. And I didn't enjoy anything which could seduce me to watch the whole thing again. So as a movie that has leverage, through story or visuals, it doesn't!You read things like how director Christopher Nolan took more than 5 years to write the script. Ok, a right info, or a false publicity, both ways, this is so hasty script that didn't care whatsoever of building anything.As for the story, forget it, because the movie itself forgot it earlier. There is a wife who wants a divorce from an abusing husband, some plutonium, gold bars, a time machine, and unseen guys from the future. Now this gibberish was being said to you by a dead language, since the plot is tremendously arduous like a complicated maze, rather unsolvable enigma. The dialogue savored not telling you one thing clearly; even the pace of uttering it was robotic. And the editing is a villain, forcing me to believe that a computer did it all. Hence, the ugly result was robots that talk and walk, made by robot that writes and directs.It doesn't have the slightest dose of drama, overstepping abstraction to emptiness, transforming the essential into non-existent, and producing tons of confusion and repulsion. Can anybody tell me what's the lead's motive, history, or profession? What he was doing in the opera, or in the airport? And how does he survive death every time? Moreover, who is Neil? How the inverted weapons can destroy the world? What's the future guys' agenda? Just think: the heroine kisses her son, so we know that she loves him, but why not writing a situation to feel that?! The answer of this, and else, is laziness. The same laziness that made the movie's protagonist named simply ""the protagonist""!To save you more pains, let's jump to the climactic sequence: The shootout is a farce. I challenge you to comprehend who was doing what, or who came from the future to save who, and how he did it. The evil man suddenly monologues to the protagonist by a fabricated phone call. Generally, the movie has one of the biggest loads of fabrication I have ever seen. The editing is faster than your attention, and every attempt to understand a thing always ends unsuccessfully. Then a final scene that talks to itself, since the movie lost you already, and still insists on gibberish!Nolan seems haunted by James Bond movies badly. He thinks that changing the scenery, from nation to another, and stuffing the time with action sequences, yet without real plot or logic--can make an enjoyable movie anyway. But you know what? In Bond movies, we have more solid characters, even if paper thin, more comprehensible events, more dazzling action, and - most importantly - no annoying timeline!Speaking of which, the movie is highly annoying for the mind. The matter of moving normally in an inverted world is awfully fatiguing for the viewer, especially with the stingiest expositions, a cold-blooded killer of a dialogue, and that villainous editing!The reviewers say strange stuff. Some said it's about technology in our lives. So how is that exactly? Is it because the leads use cell phones for instance?! Accordingly, every contemporary movie and TV show is about technology! Some say that this movie is a masterpiece. When a movie is understood only by its maker, then is it a masterpiece or self indulgence?! Long story short, these reviewers don't want to look stupid, so they blabber about anything serious, even if it was imaginary.Btw, some reviewers say that the performance of John David Washington is good. What performance then? There weren't characters to be played in the first place. In this case, how come that any actor got the chance to show acting muscles, since there wasn't a body for him?! So when Washington was saying: ""I'm the protagonist of this operation!"" it was the top of naivety and patheticness. For me, his face was mute just like the movie's drama; so if he's praised for that, I totally agree!Virtues: I liked the first conversation between the protagonist and the evil guy. The mere thought of making a thriller through an inverted world. And that's about it.So what's (Tenet) in conclusion? I can't say it is a video game. Video games have more heat and fun. Their target is about giving you entertainment, not headache. And mostly they aren't full of pedantry and recklessness. Honestly, (Tenet) is a heartless, mindless, senseless, and joyless movie. Was it Nolan's hastiness, or ego? At any rate, the aftermath is a stupid movie that thinks itself intelligent, and if you asked me, this is the worst kind at all.It's not ""style over narrative"" as much as ""style runs over narrative"", and the scary part is that it became a tenet in Hollywood lately.PS: How dare you reference (Casablanca)? It was a great movie, back when things like story and humanity were alive!"
619,Tenet,1," Utter nonsense:This movie may be glossy and pretty to look at but since it's utter nonsense it's difficult to care. The entire concept makes no sense. No characters to care about either, they are just there as set pieces."
620,Tenet,8," Christopher Nolan does James Bond -- with time travel!:I have a huge amount of respect for director Christopher Nolan. His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.Among Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.In the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.So the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.For the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.So there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing."
621,Tenet,1," Waste of time and money:Just pure crap and I did love inception. But that one had a great and understandable story while Tenet is just pure nonsense that leaves everyone confused, probably even the actors themselves. Oh, and most of the action is basically just recorded action played backwards. And the cherry on the cake is the horrible film music that makes understanding of anyways hardly understandable Dialoges even harder. They wanted to make sometime Inception 2.0 but just overdid it massively."
622,Tenet,6," Nolan's worst film to date:You can watch this once, twice or ten times; watch it forward or reverse; it doesn't matter, Nolan's story is riddled with amateur plot and technical issues. Aside from the convoluted story that has nothing to do with anyone's intellect to grasp it, Nolan threw in a bunch of useless Red Herrings and got lazy compared to his successful Inception movie. So no, you're not dumb if you didn't get this film; Nolan was just smoking some real wacky stuff to come up with this upchuck.Then add the ridiculous 250 min runtime that could've been easily told much better in 90-100 minutes, the illegible dialogue due to poor fake accents, terrible sound editing, and the annoying and overbearing B-grade film score, and you've got one heck of an annoyingly long, boring and confusing film.The casting was decent overall - mainly Pattinson, but I felt Washington wasn't convincing enough to be the Protagonist. The sets, locations and visuals were excellent, but not enough to settle down the other annoyances.It's a very generous 6/10 from me."
623,Tenet,," Worth it- but intensely cerebral for 2.5 hours with no break in tension:I respect the cinematic art that is Tenet. It's just something you experience- and if you try to follow the plot it will be confusing. But in this case, that confusion is intentional and one thing is obvious, this film is an intentional well planned out vision of Christopher Nolan. That confidence and certainty of a director is what you respect. Many great filmmakers make strange mind bending films. I think the action in Tenet was entertaining and the concept was interesting. But I feel it came up short given the storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan.I think a top tier director like Nolan has a responsibility to level the tension. A film that's super intense for 2 1/2 hours straight is stressful. The audience has to do a lot of work to try to figure out what's going on and it's exhausting. You need to pull back and let some of it simmer. I think Nolan has entered the echo chamber stage of his career. No one's going to tell him no, or that somethings not right.**this paragraph doesn't have spoilers per say, as no one knows what this film is really about- but it you haven't seen the film, spoiler alert. I feel the Indian lady (aka oracle master weapons dealer) was flat and her entire subplot could have been cut out. And I wished the opening opera scene tied into the plot more- and I think there was too much plot being revealed through dialogue. The actors were having to explain the plot- and it still didn't make sense even to them! HahaI did enjoy it. Judging on a Nolan curve, I would give it a B+. I think it's probably his fourth best film. They will probably shower it with Oscars, but 10 years from now I don't think anybody's going to be quoting Tenant or talking about it, because it's unclear what it was about- without having it explained to you in a director's commentary. And Inception and Interstellar both played with time better than Tenet.Even though it was clearly visionary, a unique piece of art that plays with the rules of the medium and the backwards action stuff was innovative... in the end, the bad guy wasn't charismatic enough and the good guys were too busy explaining the world to each other, and the ending wasn't amazing. But it was highly entertaining and that's all you can ask for."
624,Tenet,8," An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan:An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan
Well Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the best directors, but Tenet is a big problem!
At first I'm not even sure how to write a review about this movie! Complex, strange and annoying at times, and I cannot even tell if the scenario is smart or is it just complicated?
On the positive side, the acting was perfect, especially in terms of Robert. And his acting is perfect. This is clearly his best movie ever.
There are other features such as music, photography, etc. However, the movie does not match the rest of the great Nolan films, but it is not bad so I will rate it 8 out of 10."
625,Blade Runner 2049,9," Jaw dropping and richly rewarding...well worth running with:'Blade Runner' is a masterpiece and a favourite of mine. It is still to this day a genre and film landmark, and ties with 'Alien' as Ridley Scott's best film, despite being disliked at the time it has rightly gained its reputation as a classic.Hearing that there was a sequel over thirty years later left me with intrigue, with a great cast (Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford), one of the best cinematographers in the film industry today in Roger Deakins and with an equally great director on board (having liked to loved Denis Villeneuve's previous films), but also nervousness considering (with notable exceptions) the general reputation with sequels. 'Blade Runner 2049' turned out to be well worth the wait, it is easy to see why it will alienate some with its very long length (can understand the overlong criticism) and slow pace but it is even easier to understand the acclaim the film has received.Is 'Blade Runner 2049' better than 'Blade Runner' or on the same level? No. Is it nearly, or shall we say just, as good? Yes. To me it is one of Villeneuve's better films along with 'Sicario' and 'Incendies' (my least favourite of his is 'Arrival' and despite being an understandably divisive effort to me it was still good) and one of the exceptions to the general reputation of sequels. A sequel that treats its predecessor with respect (including some thoughtful and cleverly done nods to it, including quotations from the original score, even Ryan Gosling's name is a nod to the original author Phillip K Dick) and also its audience with respect. Despite its faults, it's also one of my favourite films of the year, and this year has been very hit and miss for films so this is saying quite a bit.Sure 'Blade Runner 2049' is not without its flaws. Can totally see where people are coming from criticising the length, most of the time it was not a problem but some of the time there was a sense that the length was too inflated, 20 minutes could have trimmed with no problem at all. There are a few implausibilities and contrivances here and there towards the end and much more could have been done with the underdeveloped character of Jared Leto (the only weak link in the cast, he doesn't have the presence to pull the role off and doesn't look comfortable or interested).However, 'Blade Runner 2049' does a huge amount right. It looks amazing, it's impeccably and imaginatively designed with some of the best special effects seen in a long time. It's Deakins' cinematography that particularly stands out, darkly gritty, gorgeously fluid and beautifully audacious Deakins shows that he is fully deserving of being considered one of today's best cinematographers. One cannot praise 'Blade Runner 2049' without mentioning some of the best directing Villeneuve has ever done in a contender for the best directed film of the year (well between him and Nolan for 'Dunkirk'), he is absolutely the right man for the job and shows himself to be not only completely at ease with the material but also tailor made for it. Once again there is a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge and sense of wondrous awe.Another big standout is the synthetic music score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, so well done and fitting that one doesn't miss Johann Johannsson that desperately. Though imagine what the film would have been like with his involvement, from my understanding he was originally meant to do the music but was fired for reasons that are a mystery to me and Wallfisch and Zimmer were parachuted in and did marvellously with big shoes to fill. It's appropriately hauntingly discordant, heart-pounding and tension-filled, with seeming echoes and quotes to the original's score. The sound effects are clever and thrillingly authentic, like for example the replicated wolfhound.When it comes to the writing and story, 'Blade Runner 2049' also triumphs, even if the story is not perfectly executed. The action-oriented scenes and conflicts are filled with tension and suspense as well as ingeniously choreographed, a fine example being the masterful prologue which has to be one of my favourite opening sequences of 2017. The science fiction elements are positively awe-inspiring, often making my jaw drop, while the philosophical ones are incredibly thought-provoking and never heavy-handed (many films have made a hash with this aspect, it was refreshing to see a film doing it well). Despite being a long and slow film, a vast majority of the film was richly rewarding, with a delicious quiet tension and absorbing mysterious elements.Excepting Leto, the acting is great. Best of all being Harrison Ford as a suitably world-weary Indiana Jones-like Deckard, that and the 'Apocalypse Now'-like meeting with Ryan Gosling providing a nostalgic element, and a deliciously cold-hearted Sylvia Hoeks (her character and performance being what Leto's character and performance should have been). Ryan Gosling also plays it straight to great effect.All in all, despite imperfections this jaw-dropping, richly rewarding, very respectful and visually stunning follow-up is just as good, if not quite as, as the 1982 masterpiece and one of my favourites of the year. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
626,Blade Runner 2049,9," A Beautiful and Poetic Film:Well, it's not what I expected but it was very good. A beautiful film with a of lot complex interactions.Roger Deakins' cinematography was great. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is the same guy that did 'Arrival' which I thought was good but not as good as other people thought and 'Prisoners'. He may be someone to watch. The direction in this is very strong.They avoided the 'let's do a scene like in first movie but make it BIGGER' ploy that flaws most 'sequels'. And it really doesn't feel like a sequel. It's a different story and while it builds on the the first it goes in a really interesting direction. I liked also that Deckard's role wasn't tacked on as an after thought. It's really sort of poetic and I'd like to see it again so I can get some of things I didn't get in the first go around. I gave it a 9 but I'm pretty sure that's going to change to a 10 with a little time. It really holds it's on in comparison with the original and if this is the approach they want to take with a possible 3rd movie I'm totally on board."
627,Blade Runner 2049,9," Slow and beautiful:I guess if the producers wanted to make another Blade Runner, they totally succeeded - at least so far. As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it's not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ..."
628,Blade Runner 2049,10," As Beautiful and Intriguing as Tears in Rain...:From an original 1982 theatrical showing to a Beta videotape, to a standard laserdisc, to a deluxe Criterion letterbox laserdisc, to a DVD, to a high-definition blu-ray, Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" has been viewed countless times in the original voice-over version, the European cut, the director's cut, and the final cut over the 35 years that followed its release. All those memories have not been lost in time, like tears in rain, but rather are indelible images from one of the greatest science fiction films. Thus, any thought of a sequel evokes mixed emotions. Despite the involvement of Ridley Scott, the results could be another disaster like ""More American Graffiti,"" or an undistinguished but palatable followup like ""2010,"" or a companion masterpiece like ""The Godfather Part II."" Fortunately, ""Blade Runner"" cultists can breathe a sigh of relief; while ""Blade Runner 2049"" may fall short of the unqualified masterpiece status of ""The Godfather"" sequel, at least on an initial viewing, the film enhances and builds upon, rather than diminishes, the original; however, only time will determine if ""BR2049"" will enjoy the same repeatability as the first film and join it as a timeless classic.Fresh from his outstanding work on ""Arrival,"" director Denis Villeneuve helmed ""BR2049"" with a steady hand and attention to detail, which were likely guided or inspired by Ridley Scott. Set thirty years ahead of the original film, Roger Deakins's career-best cinematography captures a future that is colder and bleaker than that portrayed by Jordan Cronenweth's original work, which has a warmer tone. However, Deakins's cooler hues are appropriate for 2049 Los Angeles, where snow has replaced rain and holographs rule rather than neon. Warm or cool, the atmospherics in both films are equally dazzling. The aurals are as captivating as the visuals; the haunting music by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch evokes the original Vangelis score without plagiarizing.The casting is also superb with Ryan Gosling spot on as K, the blade runner whose job, like Deckard's in the original film, is to retire renegade replicants. While the role may lack showy moments for an actor, Gosling's tall lean figure and enigmatic face create an image possibly more enduring than that of Harrison Ford in the original. Both Ford as an aging Rick Deckard and Edward James Olmos as a retired Gaff return to link the sequel to the first film. Among the newcomers, Robin Wright is well cast as Gosling's deadly serious, deathly pale Lieutenant Joshi of the LAPD. Ford and Olmos are not the only returnees, an origami figure and a small wood carving wordlessly connect the two Blade Runner films, and implanted memories, flying cars, outsized advertising, and transparent plastic raincoats also have encores.""Blade Runner"" cultists are best served seeing the sequel knowing little; the story unfolds as a policeman sent in pursuit of a mystery that expands upon threads in the original movie. Tthe film's length is arguably excessive, especially for those unfamiliar with the original, and ""Blade Runner"" novices may be left behind by a leisurely narrative that prizes visuals above action. However, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that rarity of movie sequels, a film that enhances and elevates the original, yet stands on its own as a masterful film. The passage of time will determine if ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Blade Runner"" become the inseparably coupled films that ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" have become, but all the elements are in place."
629,Blade Runner 2049,9," I watched Ana de Armas glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate:Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.
The Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph."
630,Blade Runner 2049,9," A phenomenal sequel:It's very rare when a modern sequel/reboot is equal to the original in terms of quality, but this movie is that rare one. It carries over the sweeping and hypnotizing cinematography, it continues the storyline in a natural way, it references the original, but doesn't rip it off, it introduces new concepts without ruining the continuity, it expands on the themes presented in the original in a very natural way, it doesn't drag nearly as much as said original and it's got a more compelling protagonist. I have a feeling I'll just enjoy this movie more and more as time goes by, and I already love it a lot. It's a movie with a lot to unpack, and I have no doubt it will improve even more on rewatches."
631,Blade Runner 2049,9," pure cinema:It's 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K's holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original's visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.The original's detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins' work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I'm not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that."
632,Blade Runner 2049,10," This was special:It's amazing after repeated viewings the lack of patience or inability moviegoers have to simply follow a plot. The lack of concentration throughout the cinema, the talking throughout and some of the comments I have read is downright disturbing. This movie is high art and some people need it spoon-feed to them. If you're not invested from the get-go, just go home.Blade Runner 2049 is not your typical movie and it was never meant to be. There are no superheroes or giant robots. Explosions are scarce and it's not funny either. It's about emotion and memories and like the original Blade Runner (1982). It poses the same Philip K Dick inspired questions about humanity - what does it mean to be human and are we just the sum of our memories? It now raises questions about artificial intelligence and real love.It is a sequel 35 years in the making to one of the most thoughtful and provocative movies ever. The original movie was a box office flop which later developed a cult following and and has since been hailed a masterpiece. Ridley Scott created a multilayered world which seduces you into a nostalgic like trance for a place which never really existed and a sequel to a film held in such high regard is rarely ever a good idea but Blade Runner 2049 is a rare exception. Think The Godfather Part II, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgment Day before it.No spoilers. We follow Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a new character and a new breed of Blade Runner on the trail of an old model replicant but what he uncovers along the way is so much bigger and threatens to shift the balance of what is left of humanity.Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) and his crew have crafted a beautiful looking film which pays homage to the original without trying to copy it at all. The same rain-soaked, neon-lit streets are present in L.A, only the Eco-system is even more shattered. Sustenance is scarce with protein farming a way of life and while there are obvious nods to the first movie 2049 relishes the opportunity to avoid the familiar and takes us outside the city limits.The cast in 2049 is excellent. Ryan Gosling carries the main story with ease, playing his detective character with an ice-cold calm until...Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, the original Blade Runner delivers a highly emotional and raw performance which I found very surprising. Not because Ford is not capable as an actor but Deckard was played so dryly in the original, especially next to Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty. Clearly time and circumstance have clearly changed him here and it's a refreshing approach.The casting choices of side characters in limited roles such as Dave Bautista, Robin Wright and Ana De Armas in her very unique role were fantastic. Jared Leto gets only a few scenes as villainous creeper Niander Wallace, the corporate tycoon with a god complex but his best 'angel', Luv (Sylvia Hoek) gets plenty and rightfully so because she's excellent.If I I had to choose any negatives from 2049 it would be need to spoon-feed the audience in scenes by adding a small flashback here and there which I thought was unnecessary. The score was clearly not Vangelis who did the first movie and made up so much of the nostalgic atmosphere in it. While good I did miss the sadness, the piano keys and blues of Vangelis for a time but could tell the score was aiming for something different, more urgent, a sense of dread which was probably more appropriate anyway with 2049 being much larger. That's not to say there aren't hints of Vangelis because there most definitely is.It has been 35 years and the need for a sequel can be debated forever. Was it necessary? No. But was it good. Yes, really good. Is it a masterpiece? I would say that it's an extremely satisfying conclusion to Deckard's story and having seen it it's made the original even better.A movie like this does not come around very often. The world needs more movies like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Ex Machina... and Blade Runner 2049. High praise.Best movie of the year!"
633,Blade Runner 2049,9, Pure Awesomeness:If anything just the visual look of this film makes it amazing. You can sit back and watch this thing on mute and still be wowed. In comparison to the original it doesn't really compare but its as good as a sequel/follow up could have possibly been and had just enough nostalgia to hit those soft spots. A brilliant film by a brilliant filmmaker.
634,Blade Runner 2049,8," Intriguing and engaging:It is 2049, 30 years after the events of the previous movie. K is a Blade Runner, a policeman who tracks down and terminates replicants (androids) whose model are viewed dangerous to society. K is himself a replicant, but has been programmed to be beneficial to society. One day he tracks down and terminates a replicant that has managed to evade detection and capture for over 28 years. In his garden are found the remains of a female replicant. Shockingly, the woman died during childbirth and the baby appears to have survived. Replicants cannot reproduce. If word gets out that they can, the human-replicant hierarchy will forever be disturbed. K must find the child, quickly. Also after it is Niander Wallace, a billionaire whose company makes replicants and whose main interest is in changing the world order.An intriguing and engaging movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies, Sicario, Arrival) and co-written by Hampton Francher, who co-wrote the screenplay for the original Blade Runner. Good plot with some great twists and turns. Some clever manipulation of the viewer too, as you are funneled down one way of thinking, only to have things turn out in another direction. This unpredictability, and requirement that you use your brain, makes for some intriguing viewing.Great special effects, without being too show-offy and gratuitous. Great action scenes too.While I have seen the original Blade Runner (in all three forms), you don't have to have seen it in order to enjoy, or even understand, this one. It works fine as a standalone movie.Solid performances by all involved.On the negative side, the plot is not entirely water-tight. There are a few key moments where things take a turn for the implausible and contrived. The end result ultimately justified these turns, making me less critical of them, but the writers could easily have developed the plot around those moments more, in order to make them less loose and clumsy.Though I thought it was going to be, the running time of 163 minutes is not an issue. The movie never drags and the time just flies by. Great movie - certainly not your average sequel."
635,Blade Runner 2049,10," One of the best sequels ever made:Visually stunning, enthralling, and an absolute epic score. Blade runner 2049 is everything a sequel needs to be. Denis Villeneuve i salute you."
636,Blade Runner 2049,9," A great sequel:Blade Runner 2049 is a fascinating movie and one of the rare sequels that outdoes the original. The cast performs great, fulfilling each role wonderfully. Gosling particularly stands out in the lead, providing the perfect balance of emotion and physicality, both of which are entirely convincing. With its thoughtful, yet not slow pacing, the story is able to come together in a way that clearly conveys every character and their motivations. The writers also gave great consideration to the relationships between various roles, displayed in the genuine interactions that take place all throughout. In turn, the emotional depth is very resonant and forces the audience to truly care about each protagonist. Altogether, the plot line feels very personal, while also focusing on a large scale thematically. The appointed central idea is a natural pick up from where the first picture left off, too. Some components of the third act may not quite entirely come together, but the story absolutely works in both developing such an impactful theme and delivering a satisfactory end to the lead's journey. In fact, the arc of this main character beautifully encapsulates the theme itself. In support of these ideas, the production is spectacular. There are various cinematic shots, and the editing is fantastic in pair with solid direction. Most notable are the visual effects that are often astounding, outmatching the capabilities of its predecessor by a landslide. The action present is beyond thrilling, as well. Just as fitting is the score and sound, which match each scene with much success. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 is an all-around awesome picture and absolutely worth a watch, especially for its outstanding visuals, great characters, and simply intriguing premise."
637,Blade Runner 2049,9," A justifed follow up and technical triumph.:When you make a sequel to a 30 year old movie, you better do it right. And unlike a certain other sequel to a 30+ year old film(s) that also includes Harrison Ford, Blade Runner 2049 respects it's elderly predecessor while also giving a good continuation of it's themes and expansion of the universe. It's tone and style by way of it's precise filmmaking, music, and diliberate use of color to convey feelings all do an excellent job of immersing us in the Blade Runner setting again and making something great technically . It definitely nails the atmosphere.This sequel takes a slow and steady pace and focuses on a new character K, who has an interesting arc himself with an element of ambiguity to who he is. In fact, all the movie's characters have distinct dialogue and reactions. They all do their part to slowly peel back the layers of this mystery behind a replicants child and the potential for the artificial to become the authentic. It constantly reminds you that everything in 2049 from whiskey to romance, is artificial, grounding you in this silent but incredibly important hunt for the truth. It expands the universe immensely with the idea of artificial birth, if replicants can...replicate, the line between man and machine becomes even further blurred than it's predecessor. I dare say it's themes are deeper across the board. It's clear that Villeneuve respected the Blade Runner name and wanted to add genuine depth to the world. At no point are there attempts to undercut the original.My only criticisms of this movie are very minor. It's been said that the first cut of this movie came out to be 4 hours long. While I certainly could watch something that looks this good for 4 hours, its too long for a standard release and we know that they had to shave off over an hour of footage, which will never be seen again. I think it's a shame that this will (probably) never be released as an extened cut because I think there are some ideas and characters that could have been expanded upon. One example is Jared Leto's character. He puts on a very interesting performance and it would have been great to see more of this and his character's perspective. When every single shot in this movie looks amazing, its reasonable to believe that much of the cut footage looks great too. The actual film that was released is great, but I think it's potential was even higher.If you still haven't seen this film, do it. It's a worthy follow up to the 1982 classic and it never breaks form. It doesn't rely on the original to tell the story and it also does NOT make the fruitless effort to recreate the original story through unnecessary fan service. It utilitlizes the old characters in meaningful and believable ways, and only as much as is necessary.This is what film sequels should be."
638,Blade Runner 2049,10," Excellent  Intellectual Science Fiction:This is an amazing piece of work. It has incredible artistry. As a visual exercise, it is breathtaking. I thought the original was way ahead of its time in creating a milieu, a dystopian world, full of disease and commercialism. Given the wonders of modern times, the world where this takes place is nonpareil. Ryan Gosling is out to eliminate the old replicants because there is a secret which needs to kept. The hierarchy is doing what it can to keep a world event from eliminating the awful world they have created. Goslin has memories, but they could have been implanted in him, so he is continually torn by dealing with details that may or may not be true. He needs to return to the place of his childhood. Harrison Ford reprises his original role of Deckard, now old and living in the ruins of Las Vegas. Evil is in control, but there is hope. The final scenes are incredible and puzzling, but it is a great challenge to the viewer."
639,Blade Runner 2049,10," One of the best sequels of all time:Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it's not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It's the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I've gone back to the cinema twice to be ""tortured"", but it's worth it.It's a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it's quite depressing. But it's so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also ""hated"" by many when they first released. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it's own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it's a natural continuation in the same universe. You don't have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It's confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it's beautiful, your mind say it's depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don't confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it's nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that's trapped in a caged mind.BR2049's story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that's what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the ""technology"", which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his ""dirty work"". In 2049 we meet his right hand ""girl"" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it's her). Luv is a ""handygirl"" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can't spoil anything, but look closely at Luv's character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can't talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it's depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It's one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn't perfect, but it's close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it's the best film I've seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that's just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!9.7/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve's next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I'm going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn."
640,Blade Runner 2049,10," A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made:Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once again based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about the original and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants (artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10"
641,Blade Runner 2049,8," Quality Sci-Fi:The user reviews seems to be over-run by a troll. Lots of repetitive 2 and 3 stars reviews that all read like they're written by the same person.It's a relief they still make movies like this; movies for adults. Yes it's a sequel, but it's quality and it stands on its own. This is real sci-fi, made with a proper budget and brought to life by artists. It's serious and paced so that you have time to think. If you're a fan of the genre and can appreciate some ambiguity and a little space for questions to breathe then I think you will appreciate this film. But if you can't remember the last time you read a book then maybe you will find this movie long and boring.The cast, acting, and plot are all quite good with only a few misses. The soundtrack doesn't blow me away but it's suitable. The visuals are incredible though and where this movie really shines; I can't think of a single moment in the film where I felt like the vision was held back by the technology available. And the scene at K's apartment with Joi (you will know it when you see it) pushed the envelope of what I thought was possible to do in a film. This one is a real stunner visually. Like the original, I expect Blade Runner 2049 to hold up extremely well over time."
642,Blade Runner 2049,8," ""I know what's real."":The year is 2049; 30 years have passed since Blade Runner Rick Deckard ""retired"" his last skin job, and vanished into the non-existent sunset with the (fellow...?) replicant Rachel. A wave of fugitive ""reps"" arise from the ashes of the Tyrell Corporation, as another generation of replicants is given birth, models that have been engineered to be obedient, even to the point of hunting down and killing their own kind, like Ryan Gosling's K (short for his serial number KD9-3.7, or his ""real name""). But, when a routine case leads to the discovery of the remains of a replicant who apparently died giving birth (something believed to be impossible), K will go on a world-shattering journey that will force him to question everything that he believed to be real, alongside a couple of ghosts from the past that haven't been seen in a long, long time.So that's the basic pitch of Blade Runner 2049 on paper, Denis Villeneuve's unlikely, long-in-in-the-works sequel to Ridley Scott's original 1982 classic, but how does it play out on film? Well, for one thing, Villeneuve & company have more than stayed true to the world that Scott helped create over 3 decades ago, while still finding new, refreshing ways to expand on that vision; the massive cityscape of 2049 Los Angeles still feels just as monolithic and oppressive as it did in 1982, especially when lensed through the eye of modern cinematography icon Roger Deakins' epic, dizzying visuals, as hints of Vangelis's legendary original score wash through the soundtrack, and, while the Tyrell Corporation is no more, many real companies from the original that went bankrupt are still around in 2049, such as Atari and Pan Am (even the Soviet Union still exists in this timeline, to demonstrate the film's fidelity to Scott's canon).And, writing-wise, Hampton Fancher and Michael Green find new ways to delve back into the original's signature themes of identity, just exactly what it means to have a soul and to be ""human"", and the ever-thinning line that supposedly still separates man from his creations, while stylistically, Villeneuve's direction strongly recalls the slow, leisurely pacing, and overall cryptic, alienating tone that keeps Scott's film such a haunting experience all these year later....recalls it a bit too much, if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, as 2049 is still a worthwhile film on the whole, and I didn't regret paying extra to see it in theaters at all, but I still couldn't help but feel it would've been better if Villeneuve hadn't tried so hard to exaggerate certain traits from the original as if to try to give us the ultimate Blade Runner experience; 2049's surreally slow pacing is sometimes pushed to the absolute breaking point, and I ended up feeling almost every single minute of the film's 2 & 1/2 hour-plus running time, and the inclusion of certain overly bizarre, dehumanized moments (especially with Jared Leto's reclusive blind industrialist Niander Wallace, who substituted creepy cataracts and pretentious, ""poetic"" ramblings in place of actual character development) just felt very forced and unnecessary, and was a bit of a cinematic turn off in the end.Still, 2049 is at its best when Villeneuve allows its sense of humanity to shine through, like with the inner pain and utter confusion that Gosling's K displays as his entire world and very sense of self gets turned completely upside down as his investigation goes deeper and deeper, or with how surprisingly touching his relationship with his holographic ""girlfriend"" Joi is; the moment where she finally gets to go outside their cramped apartment after K gives her a portable emitter, and she gets to feel rain on her ""skin"" for the first time was simply beautiful to witness, and a scene where Joi synchronizes her movements with a real woman to give K a sort of one-on-one lovemaking session is one of the coolest sci-fi visuals I've seen in recent years. It even retroactively makes the memories of Deckard & Rachel's relationship more engaging to hear about than it was to witness in the original (classic film or not, that particular aspect of Blade Runner always struck me as rather obligatory and perfunctory), but I'll stop right there, at the risk of spoiling 2049 any further than I already have.Anyway, like I said before, Blade Runner 2049 isn't a perfect film, and I can't help but feel like it could've been better with a shorter running time and a slightly more accessible tone on the whole, but I also can't help but find it a compelling cinematic experience anyway; the visuals are breathtaking, the concepts and themes are fascinating and genuinely thought-provoking, and it's the rare sequel to an iconic original that (mostly) avoids just coasting on nostalgia audiences may hold for the first film, but rather, actually does something to further develop the world created in the original, making for a ""blade"" that, flaws and all, I didn't regret running at all."
643,Blade Runner 2049,8," Beautiful Atmosphere and an Interesting Mystery Help Blade Runner 2049 Continue a Classic Story:I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A. in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale, for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an 8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10."
644,Blade Runner 2049,10," ""We're all just looking for something real"":Blade Runner 2049 expands upon the foundations of its predecessor, Blade Runner (1982). It tells a story of technology, progress and achievement and connects it to the overarching series theme of humanity and what it means to be human.And let me just say, this film looks unbelievably good. This is the absolutely the best cinematography I've ever seen. The world feels alive, crisp, and real, and some of the wide shots are simply breathtaking. Accompanied by solid performances from Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford and it's enthralling story about humanity's complex relationship with technology, Blade Runner 2049 is simply a must see film."
645,Blade Runner 2049,9," A visually stunning sci-fi which eventually will become a classic:It goes without question that Blade Runner 2049 has the best cinematography ever. Roger Deakins blew me away. The VFX was also remarkable, the production made great use of greenscreens and miniature models. I found the story very interesting, but I think it was a bit slow, which was the reason why it unfortunately underperformed in the box office. Even though I have not watched the original film, Blade Runner 2049 made me fully immersed in the great world Denis Villeneuve created. And let's not forget about the acting; Ryan Gosling nailed it in my opinion, Harrison Ford was great, and Ana de Armas was also good. I am sure that in one or two decades this film will be definitely considered a sci-fi classic."
646,Blade Runner 2049,10," The Rare Sequel That Lives Up to the Original:It's not easy to capture lightning in a bottle. Perfectly recapturing the look, sound, feel, and unique blend of elements that defined the original Blade Runner is no small task. Capturing its substance is harder still. And yet this film does it perfectly. Director Denis Villeneuve and the others involved have succeeded in creating the rare sequel that perfectly recreates the style of its predecessor while expanding on its story and themes.Ryan Gosling stars as Officer K, a new model replicant who works for the LAPD ""retiring"" unstable older models. He lives alone, except for his house's holographic interface, who gives new meaning to the phrase ""virtual girlfriend."" Like all of the new models he's very good at his job and never questions orders. At least until a ""routine retirement"" turns up a secret that challenges everything he thought he knew about his nature, and could change the global balance of power- or plunge what's left of civilization into war.The original Blade Runner asked intriguing questions about what it means to be human. 2049 goes a step further, questioning the nature of what's real. Characters struggle with whether their memories are their own, someone else's, or something entirely manufactured. The mutual affection between K and his holographic girlfriend raises the question of whether an AI can truly feel, or if there's any way for her to become a real girl. And the enduring question from the ending original Blade Runner is still very much open.Visually this film is a masterpiece of bleakness. LA is still the shadowy, run down megatropolis it was before, just a little flashier and newer. Endless sheets of rain still pour down on darkened streets as streetlights and flashing signs struggle to illuminate the perpetual gloom and holographic ads offer pleasures of every kind to passersby.Only this time the streets don't seem so crowded as before. Which makes sense given that anyone who can afford to has bought passage off planet. Because if LA is dystopian the world beyond its walls is downright post-apocalyptic. San Diego is a wasteland out of Mad Max; a vast scrapyard dotted with the ruins of old high rises and occupied only by desperate bands of scavengers and outlaws. Vegas is as quiet as a tomb; shrouded in a haze of cloud and dust, its casinos sitting as though frozen in time. And in between is only desolate emptiness as far as the eye can see. And it's all so artfully photographed and exquisitely atmospheric.Harrison Ford doesn't have as much screen time as the trailers might have suggested, but whenever he's on screen it's clear that he hasn't lost a beat. The weariness and slight grumpiness that seems to be his default setting these days serves him well as the reclusive old Deckard, gone semi-paranoid after so many years in hiding. He throws a mean punch for a man his age, and radiates a mix of anger, sadness, and tired resignation as he describes all that's transpired in the last thirty years. Gosling likewise excels in the frequent action scenes and gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as a man questioning who and what he really is.But Jared Leto might make the strongest impression. As ruthless industrialist Niander Wallace- creator of the new generation of replicants- he is a study in contradictions. His manner is eerily emotionless, yet his gaze exudes brilliance and obsession. He calls the replicants his children and speaks of their destiny and need to grow, but treats them as disposable. And his zeal to propel mankind forward makes him merciless to anyone who stands in his way. We're not entirely sure what he is either. He seems to be a cyborg, but it's unclear how far the changes go, or if he might be something more artificial altogether. What I do know is that this performance is enough to redeem him for his overwrought turn as the Joker in Suicide Squad.If this movie has a fault it's that it stays too faithful to the original's grating synthesizer soundtrack, heavy on reverb and distortion. But then again, I suppose that it does fit the film's mood and add to the sense of tension when needed. And while the fights and shootouts are very good, nothing can match Deckard's battle with Roy in the last film. Blade Runner 2049 is not quite the original, but it comes very close. And for a movie like Blade Runner that's high praise indeed."
647,Blade Runner 2049,10," Denis Villeneuve... making sci-fi great again:Los Angeles, 2049. Thirty years have passed since Deckard and Rachael fled the city to make a life of their own. The futuristic cityscapes created by visionary director Ridley Scott were the perfect backdrop for one of the most influential science-fiction films of all time. While the creative team may have changed for Blade Runner 2049, the cityscapes remain for one of the best experiences I've had at the cinema in 2017.When K (Ryan Gosling), a young blade runner, uncovers a long-buried secret that could change the future for both humans and Replicants, he tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) for answers.It's no secret that audiences didn't take to Blade Runner straight away upon its release in 1982, people not seeing the mark the film stamped in the genre of sci-fi or film history until the years after. Several versions of the film and over thirty years later, Denis Villeneuve brings us Blade Runner 2049, a direct sequel and continuation from Scott's final cut of his original film.Villeneuve, who I'd have to describe as a visionary, is one of the most exciting directors working today and he brings his A-game to Blade Runner 2049. It's always risky making a sequel after such a long time, especially for a film as renowned as Blade Runner however, from the very get go, it's clear that this film is being made by someone who is incredibly indebted to and respectful of the original.This is a beautifully crafted film, visually stunning and utterly engrossing in its narrative. I was worried about how they would take the story forward but knowing nothing about the plot and going in blind worked wonders because I was gripped from the opening shot to the very last. The runtime could have been an issue but when the film is of such a high quality, it ultimately flies by and finishes too soon if anything.The work from Roger Deakins on the film's cinematography is nothing short of masterful, surpassing Jordan Cronenweth's work on the original which is no easy task. Deakins has never won the Academy Award and if he doesn't for his work on Blade Runner 2049, I'll lose hope in him ever picking up the award. The music from Vangelis in Blade Runner was mesmerising and while both Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch ensure this film has an impressive soundtrack, it never comes close to topping Vangelis'. Coming to the performances, Blade Runner 2049 features a cast intent on making this as memorable as the original. Ryan Gosling leads the film with an impressive performance where the subtlety of facial expressions are as important as the delivery of lines, leading to arguably Gosling's best performance to date. The returning Harrison Ford is as gruff as you'd expect as a Deckard who's been in hiding for thirty years, his pivotal role in the film surprising yet incredibly worthwhile.The supporting roles, ranging from minor to major, are filled by plenty of capable actors, whether it be Jared Leto's mysterious turn as Niander Wallace or Robin Wright's authoritative showing as Lt. Joshi. The pleasant surprise was Ana de Armas, who I didn't think too much of as an actress prior to this film.Blade Runner 2049 is a heavy dose of pure science fiction that will leave a lasting impression on the genre for sure. With this and Arrival last year, Denis Villeneuve seems to be on a one man mission to make sci-fi great again."
648,Blade Runner 2049,10," May possibly be an overlooked classic on release - deja vu anyone??? ;):At time of writing, Blade Runner 2049 looks like it might underwhelm at the box office. There are probably a few reasons for that: the R rating obviously keeps children and young people, and families away; a demographic in the 18-25 range is probably pretty unfamiliar with the original movie; and its 2 hr 43 min running time probably feeling taxing to a number of contemporary moviegoers who are used to an hour and a half.However, here are my responses to each of these points:  this is the kind of ""thoughtful couples/date type movie"" for when your kids are at their grandparents or babysitters; or it would make a great works night out to watch this if you're unfamiliar because you're pretty young with the classic original Blade Runner movie, you're admitting to missing out on a classic piece of cinema that you need to watch (up there with the original Star Wars; the Godfather; the Shawshank Redemption etc.) So do yourself a favour, and rent or buy it now, rather than watch the latest average to shoddy Maze Runner sequel;  if you're put off by a film's running time, then do you really have a love of cinema at its fullest and finest?Very important the last bit, because in my opinion, this is arguably the best sci-fi sequel since Terminator 2, way back in 1991. It respects, builds on and pays homage to the original film, without being constrained by it, whilst making us look again at the original film with a new eye. Without giving away any notable spoilers, the story continues and advances the conflict of replicants pitted against humans. Whether the divide between the two parties may be coming closer to an end is illustrated in a creative and thought provoking plot development (involving the characters of the original film), which I genuinely didn't expect. The characters here are fleshed out, conflicted, and portrayed as complex and realistic, give how Earth has so tragically ended up in the environment this franchise creates. Whilst most actors here give a sterling performance, with few off notes, I'm happy to note that in a film which needed him to carry the weight of the narrative and mythos, Ryan Gosling (not my favourite actor) is outstanding in an understated, often subtle performance that marks as one of the finest of his career. I'd also probably give Robin Wright credit for her turn as the prejudiced, conflicted and brutal Lt. Joshi; Harrison Ford (who plays a latter act part, but is nevertheless a key role) gives his best performance for a character in years as a now wizened Deckard. It's interesting that, compared to the pre advertising buildup of him, Jared Leto doesn't get as much screen time as you might expect – although he's competent in what time he does have.Of course Blade Runner stories are hugely about visuals: whilst much has been said for cinematographer Roger Deakins being Oscar nominated for this (he should be), the visual effects team really have done sterling work overall. The visual look is stunning and seamless – an understandable, logical and beautiful progression from the universe of the first film, that makes me hugely excited to own this at home on Blu Ray. It's one of the few films I would recommend seeing in 3D: the effect of it is subtle and not garish as can be in 3D, and it nicely enhances certain scenes, rather than distracts from them.So any quibbles at all? Thankfully, only a few: a brief cameo from a very well loved and intriguing character of the first film is sadly all we get from that character. The score is satisfactory, and services the visuals and plot well, but it can't really come close to the classic Vangelis original. In my mind, the only person who should have really been approached for this sequel is Vangelis himself, but maybe he turned it down. We don't know. The film also ends on an intriguing cliffhanger – one which is dependent on certain characters being available and happy in future to film a subsequent sequel. I'd have probably preferred the ending to be one that could make the film a stand-alone film, like the original, whilst allowing for the possibility of sequels.Still, these are minor quibbles overall. Hopefully it will make enough through box office receipts and home video and TV (remember, it's the latter two that led Blade Runner to become a cult hit over time, rather than the original box office receipts) to make a Villeneuve led sequel. If not him, the only other two people I can ever imagine doing that sequel might be Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott. However, let this man at it again, he'd done a fantastic job here.In summary: a brilliant achievement, which hopefully opens the doorway for another film to make what might hopefully then be the best sci- fi trilogy in history – aping the Lord Of The Rings trilogy for fantasy, and the Dark Knight trilogy for the superhero comic book genre. If this gets ignored by the Oscars for the usual costume dramas, biopics, and rote drama films, there should be hell to pay."
649,Blade Runner 2049,10," Breathtaking - A Near Perfect Cinematic Achievement:I am going to offend when I write how the original Blade Runner left me disappointed. By the end, there were too many unanswered questions for me not to feel anything but jaded. Blade Runner 2049 on the other hand, left me riveted. Ryan Gosling is not exactly synonymous with action films, though from the opening scene, he proves himself to be a powerful, heroic figure. Unlike the original, which toyed with the idea that Deckard was a replicant, 2049 adamantly admits to K's (Gosling) status almost immediately. Though I could criticise Blade Runner 2049 for its anti-climatic finish, it does three things brilliantly. First, the film answers the burning questions the original refused to dignify. Secondly, the film captures the essence of the original's universe. The world feels lived in; where technology and the metal skeletons of architecture blend; where clear demographics and political allegiances exist, an 'us versus them' feel emerging that mirrors the world we live in today. Thirdly, the film immerses the viewer instantly with not just the mystery of its story, but with its score. The sound is thunderous and impactful, exploding across the screen with tremendous effect, while the raw, visceral musical score accompanies this perfectly, serenading us with themes that don't just resemble, in part, the original, but a unique cyber punk style too.The effects are phenomenal, from the fluctuating holographic interfaces, to the flying cars; from the impressive explosions to the dystopian backwaters which surround the spurring metropolis; the effects satisfyingly developing an imperfect future. Although the effects are a necessity in Blade Runner 2049, never does the feature become over-reliant on them, the film's leads been the driving force of this cinematic achievement.The film's introduction sees K completing his manhunt of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), an older model replicant, who has found some semblance of peace. K however finds himself caught up in an even bigger investigation, the ramifications of which could be dire, his lieutenant, Joshi (portrayed effectively by Robin Wright), spurring her infallible asset on. It is here we are introduced to Jared Leto's Niander Wallace, the mastermind behind the new generation replicants. Despite been in only a few scenes, his calculated malice sends cold tones throughout the feature, and is further delivered upon by his assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoecks), whose lack of decency for human life is frighteningly human.Much like the original, Blade Runner 2049 questions what makes us human, and why in the future we would attempt to differentiate ourselves from our creation, when they begin to adopt our traits. Though Gosling's K appears robotic in his movements at times, in his relationships, especially that with virtual intelligence Joi (the lovely Ana De Armas), we witness how human he truly is, their romance been as inventive as it is beautiful. The film takes itself very seriously when demonstrating the poignancy of machines sharing a connection, though the themes of slavery and child-labour, despite still been major topics today, are only briefly discussed.Acting greats like the always entertaining Lenny James, Hiam Abbas, and Edward James Olmos (reprising his role from the original) briefly appear, and despite portraying characters with barely enough screen time to be truly appreciated, their performances nonetheless propel the narrative forward. Furthermore, though Harrison Ford receives second billing, it is not until much later into the film that we are blessed by his on screen presence, his version of Deckard retaining the old 'shoot first ask questions later' routine of his character, yet being deeply melancholic and sympathetic. Blade Runner 2049 is at its core, a futuristic romance, about the importance of freedom, sacrifice and family; a film that gives me hope for the future of Hollywood. This feature is possibly the best film I have seen this year, Denis Vileneuve again proving himself to be an outstanding director."
650,Spider-Man,10," Iconic  Electrifying  Classy  Vibrant  and Emotionally Stimulating  Spider-Man Represents the Gold Standard in Superhero Blockbusters:The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100"
651,Spider-Man,9," Way better than the recent reboots:Really good movie, I enjoyed the whole Trilogy with Toby Maguire but this was the best of the 3. Willem Dafoe made an excellent villain as the Green Goblin. Excellent super hero movie."
652,Spider-Man,9," Spider-Man (2002) - With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!:Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action""."
653,Spider-Man,10," One of the best movies of the year!!!:Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the characters I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10"
654,Spider-Man,9," It's Got Magic:I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting."
655,Spider-Man,8," A really great comic book adaptation:""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics."
656,Spider-Man,10," What I was hoping for and more.:Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains."
657,Spider-Man,," Toby Maguire spins a mean web...excellent fun movie...:One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??"
658,Spider-Man,," DVD review - yep  definitely a fun movie  and a great DVD to own.:Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.no SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action.  **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now!  It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man.""  Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see."""
659,Spider-Man,10," Pre MCU:Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched, I was entranced by Spider-Man and I can't believe it doesn't even rate an 8 on IMDb. Say what? Spider-Man has heart, it has feeling, the emotion, it has it all. Willem Dafoe was born to play the Green Goblin for sure."
660,Spider-Man,8," Definitely exceeded my expectations!:I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
661,Spider-Man,, I enjoyed this movie:That movie starts the string of the spider man that I'm grown with and raise the bar really high for the next super hero movie which comes soon after it. This part is really good synthesized. I can tell much more good thing abouy the movie but you can make them on your own.
662,Spider-Man,10," An Honest Review:It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride."
663,Spider-Man,10," Best spiderman movie:Now, there are so many spiderman movies out there but this movie holds a good place in my heart becoz i just watched it when i was a kid and i had so many memories with it. And now when i rewatched it , it is really good the acting , story and vfx ,cgi is really on point. U should watch this movie if u haven't becoz it worth it."
664,Spider-Man,10," Raimi and Maguire weave a magical web in this excellent comic adaptation:Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A."
665,Spider-Man,7," Spider-Man:The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman. Peter Parker takes off his clothes while running just like Clark Kent. It is a nod that the modern superhero genre started with Richard Donner's Superman."
666,Spider-Man,9," A real film:This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe."
667,Spider-Man,," Amazingly Spectacularly Great:Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn't walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think ""Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker"". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like ""friendly neighbourhood spider-man"" are fully in-keeping with the character.
The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.All-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending."
668,Spider-Man,9," ""This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" 10 years later  it's still amazing!:Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up."
669,Spider-Man,10," This one is a winner!:This is the best comic character since Batman.  In fact, I liked this a lot better than Batman.  It did not have any slow spots.  The acting was well and the characters fitted the comic book characters to a tee.  I can not wait for the sequel.  I wonder who the villain will be.  The special affects were good, but you could tell some was computer graphics.  A must see. 10/10"
670,Spider-Man,9," A great comic adaptation:I saw this movie last night at a preview, and I must say I was impressed. The acting of all the cast was good, especially William Dafoe. I must admit that I wans't quite sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Paker, but after watching it, I cannot think of anyone who would be better suited to the role.The only places where it changes the orginal comicbook story are when the comicbook is not very believable. So these changes don't harm the story in anyway, but might even make it better.On the whole, I would have to say this movie is definately worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of the comic/cartoon series or just a general comic fan."
671,Spider-Man,8, Great power comes with great responsibilities:I have watched this earlier and I'm rewatching this again. I can't easily get over from the spiderman character. This movie has everything to keep you hooked til end.
672,Spider-Man,10," A perfect  classic  epic superhero film.:SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this."
673,Spider-Man,9," Spider-Man:The best single movie for the superhero, Toby Maguire, the best actor in the role of Spider-Man, the villain of the film was excellent, the character of Mj in the film was the closest to Mj in the comics The film embodied the world of Spiderman greatly and all other series failed to approach the level of the Tobey Maguire trilogy"
674,Spider-Man,10," Oh yeah !:I truly don't know what to say about this movie, which got already all possible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I canfrom my heart, cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammaticalsuper humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start : This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead (also directed by him) movie, Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90% on rotten tomatoes ! Spider-Man is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh, playful, innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider- Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg, Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes, with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever, but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes, including X-men franchise (Nine movies until 2016, Deadpool is really great, as well as all others, yup I like also those three banned by critics) Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movie,I guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie - acting, effects, story, scenery for me all this is 10/10 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing- 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007(also directed by Sam Raimi) was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write, they are not stupid of course, but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one (2002 and 2004) cause they said ; in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything, but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish, so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 10/10 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!"
675,R.I.P.D.,7," Not nearly as bad as a lot of people like to say it is.:'R.I.P.D.': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)One of the summer's biggest expensive casualties is this Dark Horse comic adaptation starring Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges as two police officers in the after life fighting undead ghouls. It was directed by Robert Schwentke (who also directed the action films 'RED' and 'FLIGHPLAN') and written by Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi and David Dobkin. Peter M. Lenkov created the comic book it's based on and also executive produced the film. The film also co-stars Kevin Bacon, Mary-Louise Parker, Stephanie Szostak, Marisa Miller and James Hong. Oddly both Reynolds and Parker had two big films opening the same weekend (Reynolds also can be heard in the animated family film 'TURBO' and Parker reprised her role in the sequel to Schwentke's 'RED'). All three films bombed and Reynolds now has a pretty big reputation for constantly delivering box office misfires. That doesn't mean they're bad films though and I actually enjoyed 'R.I.P.D.' to a certain degree (definitely not an especially good movie though).The film opens with a Boston cop named Nick Walker (Reynolds), having a dispute with his partner, Bobby Hayes (Bacon), over whether or not to turn in gold they found at a recent drug bust. Walker is shot and killed by Hayes during a shootout and is recruited by the R.I.P.D. (Rest In Peace Department) in the afterlife. The R.I.P.D. specializes in catching 'deados', which are souls who have refused to leave the land of the living. Walker is teamed with an old U.S. Marshal from the Old West, named Roy Pulsipher (Bridges), while he attempts to track down his old partner and clear his reputation with the love of his life, Julia Walker (Szostak). The biggest complaint I've heard about the trailer for the film is how much it resembles the film 'MEN IN BLACK' and I have to say, after seeing the film as well, that it very much resembles a 'MEN IN BLACK' movie. It's of course not nearly as good as that campy sci-fi classic but it is better than it's first sequel (arguably 'MEN IN BLACK 3' as well). The fact is the movie is not nearly as bad as a lot of people like to say it is. It's a lot of fun, funny at times and the visuals are spectacular. It had a budget of approximately $130 million and as a purely visual treat it paid off; as far as the special effects go, plus the women are all super hot (Szostak and Miller are breathtaking in the flick). Watching Reynolds and Bridges together (as an odd couple duo) is a treat as well and it's funny to see Reynolds being mostly the straight man while Bridges mostly hams it up (Bacon is also once again a great despicable villain). Not a great film by any means but not a bad one either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/NdWU81GeyN4"
676,R.I.P.D.,7," Not even close to as bad as the reviews made it seem  watch it & make up your own mind. Funny & entertaining. I liked it. I say B.:""You gonna sit there and mope or do you want to help me stop the, you know, an apocalypse?"" After things go very very wrong while out on a bust Boston PD officer Nick (Reynolds) is killed but before he heads to his judgement he is swept into an office and offered a new job. He is now a member of the R.I.P.D. and along with his new partner Roy (Bridges) they set out to capture the Dead-O's that roam free. When Nick finds a connection between the Dead-O's and his death things turn personal. I have to start off by saying that I wasn't really expecting this to be good at all. I'm not sure why but when I say the preview I immediately expected another Men In Black and didn't think it was needed. While I won't say this wasn't Men In Black like, it was much better then I expected and did laugh and was entertained most of the way through. This is very much geared toward a young teen crowd but I still found it funny. I do have to say though that without Reynolds and Bridges this may have been unwatchable. I did like it and am glad I saw it but this isn't something I'd watch again, but keep in mind I expected this to be as bad as all the reviews it got. A combination of Men In Black with a dash of Howard The Duck thrown in. Watchable but really only once. Overall, not even close to as bad as the reviews made it seem, watch it and make up your own mind. I give it a B."
677,R.I.P.D.,8, Good summer entertainment:When I first saw the trailer for R.I.P.D. there were 2 things that made me wanna see it. 1. I love Ryan Reynolds Jeff Bridges and Kevin Bacon. 2. It just looked really entertaining. Thats not to say of course that this movie is without it's flaws.You do get a feeling like in a way you have already seen this movie before and thats because in some ways it's a lot like Men in Black. that does somewhat pull you out of the movie at times but it really is not that big a problem. In my opinion the pros in this movie far out weigh the cons. It is a fun movie with interesting and likable characters. A cool idea that is fairly well writtin and just an overall fun movie to watch.Thats really all I have to say about R.I.P.D. I don't really understand all of the hate thats it has gotten it really does not deserve all of that. Have people forgotten how to just have fun sometimes? I give R.I.P.D. a 7.5/10
678,R.I.P.D.,8," An effective spoof of the Men-In-Black genre.:Foghorn Leghorn comes alive in the person of Roy in this hilarious spoof of the Men in Black series. After reading a slew of reviews that trashed this movie, I decided to watch the movie and judge for myself. Apparently, what I watched significantly differed from what these other reviewers had seen. This movie is obviously a spoof on the Men-In-Black movies, with Jeff Bridges reprieving his Rooster Cogburn role, this time in a character named Roy, with highly amusing results. Indeed at times Bridges performance is hilarious as he and his sidekick Nick bicker and exchange taunts and insults when not destroying ""Deadies"" who have escaped back to earth. Although Ryan Reynolds co-stars, Bridges dominates the movie. His performance is so strong that he overshadows every other cast member in the movie. Although some of the special effects are cheesy and most of the story is hokey and contrived, such as the love interest between Nick and his wife which really stretches literary license to the limit, the movie nevertheless is engaging and keeps the audience's attention. This is the case because despite his gruffness, Roy is an engaging character. Mary Louise Parker and Kevin Bacon perform wonderfully in supporting roles, with Parker demonstrating a talent for dead-pan humor and Bacon playing a bad guy with much effectiveness. Furthermore, the movie ends on an upbeat note, with the two main characters having resolved the interpersonal issues that had initially strained their relationship. Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds work well together; also, Bridges sings two songs, revealing an excellent singing voice. If one is expecting a sci-fi classic, you will be disappointed. But if one is expecting a well-crafted comedy that will keep you entertained, then you will be gratified."
679,R.I.P.D.,7," Somewhat Generic and predictable  but I still enjoyed it.:The movie basically follows the three act formula, and although the crusty veteran and out of element rookie has been done before I enjoyed Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds on the screen together. There is plenty action and a fair amount of comedy. there were some plot holes and the ending left a few unanswered questions. Even with these flaws my wife and I both feel like there are many worse ways to spend a few bucks on a hot afternoon. This is not a blockbuster or a classic movie, I would classify it as a good popcorn flick. Contrary to many other opinions here we both recommend this as a watchable movie, as long as your expectations are reasonable."
680,R.I.P.D.,7," Way Underappreciated Popcorn Flick:I don't understand all the hate for RIPD. I get that it's invariably gonna be compared with MiB because they share the same theme, but just because MiB is the superior movie doesn't mean RIPD isn't enjoyable. It has a great cast, good special effects, and an interesting premise. Take it for what it is.... If you go into it looking for a masterpiece, prepare for disappointment. If you just want to be entertained by a pretty good sci-fi movie with some solid laughs, try RIPD out. Just my 2 cents."
681,R.I.P.D.,6, Starts well but gets boring:The first act of the movie with the discovery of cop's new life is fun and brings great moments between Reynolds and Bridges. The rest of the movie is more than average with poor special effects and a predictable story.
682,R.I.P.D.,7," Exactly what I expected:R.I.P.D. is exactly what it looks like. The plot was not mind-blowing but it was good enough to hold my attention, the acting was not Oscar worthy but they did a very good job in their respective roles and it wasn't the funniest thing I've ever seen but I did laugh. I would almost categorize this as an action before a comedy, it's got quite a bit going on! I liked the second half of the movie more than the first, though that's not to say the first half was bad. It just felt a little repetitive and right about the time I began to feel like it was going to go in circles, it kept moving and saved itself. The second half steps it up in both action and comedy and the climactic ending was great.Overall I enjoyed R.I.P.D. It was just a fun movie that you don't need to think about!"
683,R.I.P.D.,7," Predictable? Yes. Fun? Yes!:I mean I get it. People were comparing this to Men in Black even before it was released. Unfortunately for the producers and the makers of the film this didn't make nowhere near that kind of money (box office wise). Instead it seems that Ryan Reynolds is Box Office poison. The superhero movie (Green Lantern) and now this.He might have been the hope for some studios but I'm not sure if they are still willing to bet money on him. And it's unfortunate, especially because his chemistry with Jeff Bridges is really amazing! There are quite a lot of funny moments in this and it would be fun to see where this would be heading. Having another A-Lister with Kevin Bacon you do wonder why this went south. Great special effects too (they had a good budget to do this though)"
684,R.I.P.D.,5," N.O.P.E.:I was wondering how I could have missed this movie? Well, it aint worth a watch, that's why.The bad: many other reviewers (rightfully) already complained about the fact that this movie is nothing else but a cheap and inferior copy of the Men In Black.More bad: the acting by Jeff Bridges is quite annoying. And I love this actor in many other movies, but this time around I just cant stand his cheesy, superficial performance.Even more bad: it is indeed (as many others also have mentioned) not really funny, while it is definitely suppose to be funny.Not any good? Well, the photography and the special effects are good. Lots of money was spent on this movie. And for those who never have seen the Men in Black movies, perhaps some might even think this movie is ""okay-ish""..."
685,R.I.P.D.,6," RIPD review:From the trailer, I had high hopes this film would deliver a smashing spectacle with great humor and a unique premise. Alas, this turned out to be one of those cases where the trailer is better than the movie itself.To be fair, the film has its moments. The comedy never made me laugh outright, but there are amusing lines and situations throughout. Some of the most amusing moments emerge from the interplay between the characters, and the clever gag in which everybody sees them as different people. As far as the action goes, there is quite a bit of mass destruction and plenty of shoot-outs and fights. However, it is very manic, over-the-top, and strangely cartoony. The overall tone felt really uneven; the movie was fairly serious at times, deadpan in others, and overblown the rest of the time. I was never bored, but I was never fully engaged or invested in things.It is a shame, because the film has some unique ideas here and there. The overall premise of an undead police department is pretty neat, they use a lot of cool weapons, and they have some really quirky rules and ideas. It's a weird world where Indian food causes the villainous ""dead-o's"" to ""pop"" into gaudy monsters (if you remember the beginning of Van Helsing, with Mr. Hyde...pretty much all the monsters look like that, perhaps cross-bred with the zombies from I Am Legend). Everybody perceives the two main characters as a hot blonde chick and an old Chinese dude. Sounds fun, right? For whatever reason, it all comes off as a superfluous effort to build comedy from being weird; it worked so well for the Men In Black films, but it all falls rather flat in RIPD.The story overall is pretty fast and compact. It does a fine enough job of introducing the characters, slapping them together, and crafting some dynamic chemistry between them. However, the plot is pretty standard fare, and it never takes the time to truly invest the audience in the world it portrays. It shows just enough to make the plot work, but it never explains much, never builds on the things it briefly touches on, and never really makes us care.The film uses a lot of stylish camera moves, fast-zooms, and slow-motion effects, which you could either see as being really cool or really dumb. Editing is okay in general. Acting is a mixed bag: Ryan Reynolds is strangely flat and emotionless throughout, save for the few love scenes, while Jeff Bridges steals the show repeatedly, in a role that almost seems to parody his role from True Grit. Kevin Bacon is pretty much himself, and I loved watching Mary-Louise Parker. Writing is not that great. This production uses okay sets, props, and costumes. Special effects look cool, but are on the cheap side. Music is hip and fun.In the end, I couldn't help but to think of other films and how much better they are than RIPD. For stories that involve parallels between worlds of the living and worlds of the dead, I couldn't help but to think that the Bleach anime was a better story, and the Dead Like Me TV series was funnier. For that same concept with the perfect blend of action and comedy, the two Hellboy movies are effectively perfect. For comic-book-inspired stories about enforcers tackling the supernatural without the general public knowing, the three Men In Black movies succeed in everything RIPD tried to do, but failed. And even with the climax, with the dead threatening to rise up and end the world, I couldn't help but to remember how much better Ghostbusters was in this field. RIPD even has a brief staircase gag that reminded me of GB. All of those come recommended, but RIPD, not so much.Given its poor box office reception, I think it's safe to say that RIPD will Rest in Piece, buried alongside such equally marginal pictures as Jonah Hex and Priest.3/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Marginal | Film: Average)"
686,R.I.P.D.,6," Silly but Entertaining M.I.B. and Blade Runner Rip-off:In Boston, the dirty cop Nick (Ryan Reynolds) hides gold that he has stolen from drug-dealers with his partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) in the backyard of his house. However, on the next morning, Nick tells Hayes that he will deliver the evidence to the police since he loves his wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak) and he could not face her acting that way. Nick and Hayes are assigned to a raid against a dangerous gang and unexpectedly Hayes kills Nick.Nick is drawn by a tunnel and based on his previous experience in the police department, he is assigned in the afterlife by the Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker) to join the Rest in Peace Department that protects the living world from the undead and work with the old- fashioned agent Roy (Jeff Bridges). Roy and Nick accidentally find that Hayes in plotting a scheme to revert the sense of the tunnel to the afterlife and bring the Apocalypse to Earth.""R.I.P.D."" is a silly but entertaining M.I.B. and Blade Runner rip-off combined with the clichés of a rookie cop that is assigned to work with a veteran one. Why Hayes had split the gold with Nick if he intended to use in his scheme is one of the many holes in the plot that alternates funny with silly and annoying moments. However, ""R.I.P.D."" is an entertaining popcorn in the end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""R.I.P.D. - Agentes do Além"" (""R.I.P.D. - Agents from Beyond"")"
687,R.I.P.D.,7," Far better than the critics claim:Yes, it's formulaic in some areas. As a writer, I could see several of the plot elements more or less from the beginning. But this movie isn't intended to be complex, or at an ""Avenger"" level in terms of characterization. It's just plain good summer fun, with an interesting cast and a lot of laughs. Jeff Bridges is priceless, and he & Ryan Reynolds work well together. Ryan, with his trademark choirboy looks and deadpan delivery, is definitely watchable. Mary Louise Parker, with a scarily perky character who gets to chew the scenery with a load of offbeat lines, is wonderful as the Proctor.Some reviewers seem to insist on portraying the film as a poor man's ripoff of Men In Black, or Ghostbusters. It's neither. It's just a fun, wisecracking film based on a well known genre comic from independent publisher Dark Horse. Go, have some popcorn, laugh a lot, and enjoy the summer."
688,R.I.P.D.,7," What did you expect?!:Seen this 5 days ago and I loved it! Don't really understand what the hate is about or whats the deal with the critics and the awful 25 rating on metascore. The movie does what its supposed to,it entertains,its fun,its not heavy,just plain summertime fun. And all the comparisons with MIB?! They ONLY replaced the alien angle with the deados angle,and its not agent K and J,but its ONLY 2 dead guys,and one of them is a Wild West lawman. This has nothing to do with MIB,plus its a better movie than the last two sequels of MIB. And people say they took the rookie/veteran mismatch from MIB,although it was already done in a million different movies before MIB. I know i've mentioned MIB quiet a few times in this review,but all for you to see that it is nothing like it. Go see it and you won't regret it. Jeff Bridges is hilarious and Ryan Reynolds is cool as always. Its fast,its fun,the special effects are great. Do yourself a favor,buy a lot of popcorn,sit back and enjoy the ride!"
689,R.I.P.D.,9," A Good Mix of Previous Material along with its own originality:Dark Horse Comics isn't one of the most publicized comic book companies around but they are just as significant as Marvel and DC. Starting all the way back to 1992, Dark Horse has produced their own adaptations to movie industry of their own popular comics. Unfortunately, most of their films did not gain the recognition they deserved because most of them weren't supported enough. Plus, most weren't bad to begin with. On that note, it's important to understand that this movie isn't just a copy of Ghost Busters (1984) and Men In Black (1997); it's mix along with its own unique traits.The reason why people relate this film to those two movies because it's about a duo, one is newbie and the other, a wisecracking veteran who work together on a paranormal force to take down ghost like creatures. But there's more to that. To get into this division known as the ""Rest In Piece Department"", you have to die; which is exactly how our main character Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) finds out about this place. What's interesting just about this concept is that the R.I.P.D. exists along side Heaven and Hell. Even if they aren't mentioned directly, it is shown that this particular division is able to have a say on who can join and who can't. Interesting and cool at the same time because it's a third way out if one isn't sure if you're making it to Heaven.Now it's time to elaborate on the actual antagonists. The ""ghosts"" that the R.I.P.D. fight are ""ghost like"" in the sense that they are killed in a ghost like fashion. But honestly, they're more like zombies called Deados, which gives it a unique spin. In Men In Black (1997), Agent K & J used various techniques to unmask aliens in disguise. That's done here is as well but in a goofier fashion using Q&A cards and, another interesting clue is that the Deados cause things to decay around them. That's also awesome; a cool giveaway.Back to characters, partnering up with Walker (Reynolds) is Roy played by the charismatic Jeff Bridges. Both these two actors share some good on screen chemistry. Reynolds was the weaker half but he still played his character fairly well, however, he did embody the comic character more accurately as well as Bridges. Another one of a kind thing about these characters is how they're disguised as other people. Bridges as model Marisa Miller and Reynolds as James Hong - from the outside, it is one funny looking couple. Don't forget that you also can't die falling off buildings or getting hit by falling cars. Yeah, that's pretty awesome, it's like the writers incorporated a little bit ""indestructible"" into the equation; sounds kind of like The Mask (1994)...another Dark Horse property.But that's not all, Kevin Bacon plays Hayes, Nick Walker's human partner. Actually it's been two years since Bacon has been in a movie, so it's nice to see him again. Also Proctor played by Mary-Louise Parker was done well too, her performance was possibly the most deadpan and it worked. Even more interesting is that she carries a small relationship with Roy. The special effects should be appreciated as well. One of the better-looking aspects of the film are the vortexes. They carry a beauty to them that make it irresistible to look away; maybe because it reminds me of Disney's The Black Hole (1979), I don't know.One other part that was different about the special effects was the stop motion frames, where everything froze. That was different too, to just walk around and see everything as it was when you died was eerie. The direction was also well executed. Robert Schwentke, who directed the first RED (2010) film is at the helm and his ability to keep the audiences attention is done in the correct manner. Plus his shots move fluently, which makes it an easygoing viewing experience. I do have to pick a little with the writing though. A significant part of the plot relies on an ancient artifact, which to me is used way too often. There could've been something a little more interesting to use. The music composed by Christophe Beck wasn't bad either. Most of the time, the tracks were light and goofy and even had a twang in it for the character of Roy. There was even one scene where Bridges is at a stare down and music is being played where it sounds like a mix between Daft Punk's Tron: Legacy (2010) score and Ennio Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1961). What was even more effective were the softer moments, Beck knew how to evoke the right emotions there. My only pick with him is that his score is a little too light, as in its not as present as should have been in the film. There was also a main theme which is important for a franchise to have. So honestly, to say that this movie doesn't have good quality may be judging it too quickly.Dark Horse Comics may not be as massive as DC or Marvel but they still produce very entertaining films. The characters are funny, the special effects are unique which allows it stand by itself even if it does take parts of other films before it."
690,R.I.P.D.,2," Yep  it's as bad as people say.:Top review read ""not as bad as the negative reviews says"" so I watched it. But the fact is, it's just as bad as the negative reviews say. It really is.This movie is cliche, unfunny, sappy and boring at the same time. Meanwhile, the concepts, characters and dialogue are all mediocre at best and downright cringy at worst. It's also no way near as clever as it thinks it is. Put simply this is just a poorly written movie. The actors do their best with what they're given but, well, that only go so far. And yes, it is absolutely a ripoff of MIB, but not a good one.To summarize: Don't bother. Not even on Netflix. There are so many better films."
691,R.I.P.D.,1," Not funny and not exciting - no wonder it flopped:If James Hong's scenes are the funniest part of this movie you know this movie is in trouble.Its badly written - not funny with banal banter between the lead actors and characters that aren't endearing. Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds are dead cops who come back to earth as Marissa Miller (S.I. model) and James Hong (old Chinese man). The latter pair don't have enough screen time, and it's a shame since their scenes are the only funny part of this. Jeff spends too much time mumbling and swallows most of his jokes. Ryan looks too serious most of the time and doesn't have good lines.Men in Black was already wearing thin so the monster like villains in RIPD aren't watchable here. The battles on the unattractive streets of Boston are dizzying with repetitive flinging around. Mary Louise Parker isn't endearing as some Proctor in cop heaven. Kevin Bacon is Ryan's cop partner.Don't waste your time."
692,R.I.P.D.,1," DOA: Woeful mashup of MEN IN BLACK meets GHOST BUSTERS attempt at a new sci-fi/comedy franchise; Truly one of the worst films of the year.:R.I.P.D. (2013) * Jeff Bridges, Ryan Reynolds, Kevin Bacon, Mary-Louise Parker, Stephanie Szostak, James Hong, Marisa Miller, Robert Knepper, Mike O'Malley. DOA - Woeful mashup of MEN IN BLACK meets GHOST BUSTERS attempt at a new sci-fi/comedy franchise based on a comic book by Peter M. Lenkov about an elite supernatural crime fighting force (Rest In Peace Department, get it?) with recently killed-in-the-line-of-fire cop Reynolds teamed up with Old West peace officer Bridges (channeling his Rooster Cogburn with a mouthful of gravel; seriously he's barely comprehensible and I love Bridges but whoa; really bad choice here to go with that) to, what else, save the world from nefarious 'dead-os' (evil dead). Yeah I know. The hackneyed screenplay by Phil Haym Matt Manfredi & David Dobkin delivers no laughs, character development or entertainment and the D-grade level CGI is dreadfully cheesy (do we really need TWO obese 'dead-os'? The monstrosities here are just monstrously tediously terrible). Robert Schwentke is responsible for the reprehensible 'direction'. Truly one of the worst films of the year."
693,R.I.P.D.,," About As Fun As Pouring Acid on Yourself:R.I.P.D. (2013)* 1/2 (out of 4) A cop (Ryan Reynolds) is killed by his partner (Kevin Bacon) but instead of going ""up or down"" he's given a second chance in a police department for dead cops who keep monsters from walking the real streets. He's teamed up with the old school Roy (Jeff Bridges) and soon they realize that the killer partner has something bigger up his sleeve. R.I.P.D. is a complete misfire from the opening scenes to the closing credits. Obviously this thing was influenced by MEN IN BLACK but there are touches of GHOSTBUSTERS and GHOST thrown in for good measure but sadly nothing here works. We can start with Reynolds who is just downright boring here. He has a hard time carrying the material and this certainly isn't good for this type of comedy. Another problem is that Bridges is pretty much playing The Dude once again with a bit of his TRUE GRIT character thrown in. Personally speaking, I'm growing tired of this skit and it's too bad that one of the best character actors out there has to resort to this. Even worse is the fact that Reynolds and Bridges has zero chemistry together and they simply can't play off one another. Bridges does have a few good moments with Mary-Louise Parker and it's a shame that the entire movie didn't center around them. Bacon is fun playing the bad guy. The special effects are all decent but there's no imagination to be found in them or the monsters themselves. The screenplay is one boring scene after another and none of the action scenes contain any fun. Even worse is the love story, which is obviously influenced by the one in GHOST but here it's just laughable. Is this really what a $120+ million budget gets you these days?"
694,R.I.P.D.,5," Goofy  but fun!:Listen, I'm a sucker for films like this even if they are a bit Corny. I can often forgive a lot if they're at least entertaining. So often, I want nothing more than to just shut my brain off and watch something simple and goofy. RIPD falls into that exact category. The plot, premise and so much of the story in this is goofy but fun. The acting is a bit over-the-top but enjoyable. The score fits and it's shot well. The FXs are super cartoon and CGI, but work (think Men In Black) Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds have a good chemistry and Kevin Bacon works as the asshole I'm not saying this is a good film by any means. I also 100% understand why people don't or won't like it, but I find it enjoyable for what it is. For me, it harkens back to the Sword & Sorcery films of the 80's, same idea in on the enjoyability level. If you like these types of films, you'll probably enjoy this one and can take it for what it is. If that's not your cup of tea, then it's a good idea to skip this one.My Rating: 5/10"
695,R.I.P.D.,4," Lame Men in Black rip-off with some of the sloppiest scripting ever:R.I.P.D. is the latest big-bucks Hollywood blockbuster to attempt to entertain audiences by throwing constant, large-scale, mindless CGI at them. It needs the CGI to get through, because story-wise it's a real mess. A supernatural-themed spin on MEN IN BLACK, the story sees a newly-departed Ryan Reynolds hooking up with veteran Jeff Bridges to kick ass in the spirit world.What follows is a completely soulless (no pun intended) comedy adventure in which every joke and attempted joke falls flat. It becomes embarrassing before long, not least because Reynolds is so EARNEST...and hopeless with it. Bridges is more reliable, but he seems to have become a mumbler these days so half of his lines slipped me by.Once it finishes ripping off MEN IN BLACK, R.I.P.D. turns into some kind of GHOSTBUSTERS riff, although it's a far cry from that classic movie. The CGI is rather lamentable considering the number of dollars spent on it, and the characters are so predictable that you'll be sighing at the sloppy writing. Poor old Kevin Bacon, reduced to this kind of nonsense. Once more, Hollywood brings out a movie where fun is made of ethnic minorities, women, and the obese, and where the scriptwriters expect us not to notice at just how many plot holes and goofs are present throughout."
696,R.I.P.D.,6," Better Than Expected.:R.I.P.D (2013): Dir: Robert Schwentke / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Bacon, Mary-Louise Parker, James Hong: High budget comedy about the preservation of life. Ryan Reynolds plays a cop killed in action by his partner. From there his soul is whisked into some sort of spiritual police station where his skills are put to use in taking down demons disguised as humans. He is reluctantly partnered with Jeff Bridges whose Texan babble provides much amusement. The plot regards pieces of gold that must be gathered in order to prevent a ridiculous disaster. Setup and structure is detailed and entertaining but ultimately this is too much of a xerox of Men in Black only instead of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones we have Reynolds and Bridges. This is not bad since Reynolds holds his own as someone trying to vent judgement when his girlfriend is being mislead by his former partner. Bridges steals scenes as a sort of Sheriff / cowboy who is fearless in the face of evil. They are disguised with new identities that humans only see. Reynolds is an elderly Chinese man and Bridges is a sexy super model. Kevin Bacon is obvious from the get go as the double crossing partner, and Mary-Louise Parker does what she can as a sort of director of R.I.P.D. James Hong and Marisa Miller are the faces that living folks see when they come across the heroic duo. The climax is the standard action noise to save humanity and other pointless nonsense. This is no Men in Black by any stretch but its special effects and appealing leads allow life to submerge in this entertaining mess. Score: 6 / 10"
697,R.I.P.D.,4," The ""M.I.B."" we never asked for.:Eh.  Listen, if you've seen any of the Men In Black movies, then there's no  need to see this, because it's basically THE SAME DAMN MOVIE. Swap Will  Smith and Tommy Lee Jones out for Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges, swap  aliens for ghosts/undeads, update the CGI a bit, replace a few letters  from the title, and you have R.I.P.D. It's as close to a blatant  rip-off as you can get without naming this ""M.I.B. 4"".  ""But D, Men in Black is such a great movie, wouldn't that make this one  good, even if it's just a copy?""  No, and here's why: the execution. You can have the New England  Patriots' entire playbook, but it don't mean a thing if you don't have  Tom Brady running the plays. (Being a Giants fan, I gave myself a  little chuckle with that analogy...lol) Ryan Reynolds is witty enough,  but he's not Will Smith. Jeff Bridges is great, but this script isn't  strong enough, and even he starts to lose his appeal towards the end.  Oh, by the way, did you know Kevin Bacon is in this? Neither did I! Why  is that? Have we reached a point in our world where we officially hate  this guy to the point where we avoid telling you that he's in the film?  I thought he was on a comeback since his show on FOX was doing  well...strange. For what it's worth, he plays a solid villain, but he  can only do so much with this script.  Graphics are nice, but 3D is largely unnecessary. The action is OK, but  even the guns feel like a M.I.B. rip-off. There really aren't any  strong points to talk about with this movie...nothing that justifies  shelling out hard-earned $$$, especially when Pacific Rim is still out  there.  R.I.P.D. scores a 2 out of 5 on The BDBOS. Don't waste your time."
698,R.I.P.D.,3," RIP:This is... Yikes. It feels so much like a movie by committee, a bunch of people in a room thinking that MIB was a big hit so lets do it again but slightly different and dumber. Bridges is funny as the irreverent cowboy and earns a chuckle here and there and Reynolds is Reynolds but it feels like he's trying to be a touch to earnest in this ridiculous mess. That may be a part of the problem as well. This is a goofy movie but it tries to play it serious at times and it just doesn't work. When you combine that with some overacting, ridiculous dialogue, bad CGI and a plot/story/world that feels soooooo derivative of a popular franchise it just makes for a sigh-inducing watch with nothing enjoyable enough to redeem it.Skip this. You miss nothing of note by avoiding it. There's a touch of just... I could see a goofy version of this movie being made and being stupid but entertaining. This is just stupid. RIP RIPD."
699,R.I.P.D.,4," It's a really stupid movie that forgets to add fun or thrills:After Nick (Ryan Reynolds) gets cold feet about hoarding gold from a bust, he gets murdered by his partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) He joins the rest in peace department, and is paired up with Roy (Jeff Bridges) a crusty Marshall who lived in the 1800's. Many undead people start swarming Boston, and it's up to Nick & Roy to rid Boston of the undead. What a dud this turned out to be. It comes across like a poor variation of Men in Black, only without the entertainment. It's very cartoonish, with plenty of annoying characters and situations. The idea is potentially a great one. They could have done something really neat with the premise, but they butchered it with a silly storyline, and an overly jokey tone. Another problem with R.I.P.D is that it's thoroughly predictable. I didn't exactly predict the ending, but I had a general idea of how it was gonna go down, and I was pretty spot on with it. It does the Matrix style of action, with the slow motion; that style has become very redundant and it's now thoroughly annoying. There is plenty of dull building destruction, along with some uninspired shootouts as well, if that interests you. The acting is disappointing. Ryan Reynolds is a favorite of mine, but he can't do much with the material in this one. He is much too blasé with his situation (You're dead! Why are you so cool about it?) His character isn't sympathetic enough, and he shockingly lacks the charisma needed for this role. His chemistry with Jeff Bridges is quite awful. Jeff Bridges was mediocre. He talks like he has cotton balls in his mouth, and his character grated my nerves rather quickly. This part is beneath him, anyway, but he wasn't the Jeff Bridges I've come to know and love. What was up with that ankle fetish of his, did they think that would be funny? Kevin Bacon is at least fun as the villain. There is an OK twist with his character, and he hams it up. It was a wise choice, considering how crappy this movie was. Mary-Louise Parker has a thankless role, and doesn't do much, but flirt with Bridges. Final Thoughts: This bombed for a reason. It's fairly derivative, unexciting, overly silly, and just a complete misfire. This is one of those rare times where I could have used a more serious storyline. I'm personally gonna say you should pass on this one4.2/10"
700,Don't Look Up,7," Someone made a meme movie out of the US:And boy is it funny, because it's true. But it's also sad because it's true.Its got an idiot president, idiot media, idiot citizens and some very few smart people that must fell like they ended up in the planet of the apes. Its really accurate, scary accurate."
701,Don't Look Up,9," A really good movie  yet painful to watch:I understand why some people hate this film. It feels real in its entirety, it shows you how stupid and insignificant we are and it is extremely apropos today. Also, it was marketed as a comedy, when in fact is a dramatic film that is humorous only in its accurate portrayal of humanity. Then again some people try to ""tell you"" what it is about and, while it is certainly metaphoric, it isn't about anything more specific than ourselves. It is a mirror. Some people don't like what they see in it.I found it an almost perfect film, with some deliciously carefully crafted moments and great acting. At first I thought the comedic side was actually too much and wished that someone like Steven Soderbergh made the movie instead, but as I was watching it I started to appreciate how methodical the approach was and now I believe Adam McKay was the right man for the job. I enjoyed the overall plot, I liked the characters and how things were presented, but I loved the little things like, for example, the only scene where Europe is mentioned, as a short scene of a news item when they say they are going to convene and find their own solution, resulting in absolutely nothing. I am European and sad to say it struck home. Or the meal scene at the end, which is both emotional, focusing and reminding us how even that option can be taken away by something as small as a virus.Annoyingly, in these days movies from the U. S. are becoming more and more of ""a color"". They are not telling a story, but are taking a side. They are either democrat or republican, conservative or liberal, blue or red, flyover or coast. Don't Look Up is not a big offender, but the language and presentation was clearly on the ""coast"" side. Thus, it will be probably appreciated by people who already saw the world this way and ignored or at best maligned by the people on the other side. And it's a pity, because this film is meant to bring us together as a civilization and not keep us divided. I feel like it could have done a better job in that direction.There was one detail that I think McKay got completely wrong. There is no chance in hell the president of the United States would make a public speech and use metric units like kilometers in it. If it weren't for that, I would have rated this 10 stars. Jokes aside, this is a movie you have to watch."
702,Don't Look Up,8," Political satire at its best.:Spoiler free review.I wasn't exactly gripped by the plot, but the cast, yes please, this film boasts one impressive line up.I thoroughly enjoyed it, it managed to mix up subtlety with brashness incredibly well, it pokes fun at modern cultures, celebrity and the absurdities of social media.I spoke to a few people that found it rather funny, I can't say I was amused, but I certainly was entertained. The absurdity amused me, I pondered if some events would happen if the world did actually face disaster. The rich getting richer in the face of disaster.....Merryl Street as always was first class, but for me the standout had to be Di Caprio, he was terrific throughout, that scene where he blows his top, incredible.Thoroughly enjoyable, 8/10."
703,Don't Look Up,8," Funny and chillingly accurate and plausible:Two astronomers discover a massive comet heading towards Earth. The comet will wipe out mankind in six months' time if nothing is done about it. They manage to gain an audience with the US President, land on TV talk shows and have their story printed in the media but everyone seems to have other priorities.On the surface a disaster movie in the vein of Armageddon or Deep Impact. However, it is not just that and is far better than that.Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short, Vice, The Other Guys, Anchorman), Don't Look Up is a funny, accurate examination of the warped priorities and agendas of the people who have the largest control over our lives. Politicians care more about how something will impact their polling numbers than saving mankind, the media cares more about finding something slanderous on a person than alerting people to imminent destruction, talk shows care more about sensationalism, the personal lives of vapid pop stars and on putting on a happy face than on news that actually matters to people, corporate opportunists who use even a planet-destroying disaster to make a profit and in so doing increase the danger (and how the politicians fall in line behind them).It is all quite chillingly accurate and plausible: from experience you can relate to the misguided, self-absorbed agendas of these institutions and individuals and the powerlessness and irritation you feel in having to deal with them and their decisions.It is so close to home that it sometimes makes the film irritating to watch: you'd rather not be reminded how incompetent, superficial, self-servicing and nefarious the government, media etc are, how they screw up your life on a regular basis and how likely it is that they will eventually wipe out mankind.All this makes for a film that is one part hilariously funny and another part scarily serious and confronting. Unlike some other movies I did not find this mix of comedy and drama jarring. In fact, the humour helps point out the absurdity of it all.By the way, keep watching until the very end. There's two scenes woven into/after the credits that are worth sticking around for."
704,Don't Look Up,8," We really did have everything:This seems like a film about a comet headed to earth to destroy the planet. It is really a satire about society. It spoofs the social media and how politics and truth deniers argue about facts while killing the planet. If you look up into the sky, you will see the comet. The title in the mantra of those who believe the comet is a conspiracy. Tech industry leaders and talk show hosts are also satirized. It would be really funny if not so true.Guide: f-word. Brief sex and nudity."
705,Don't Look Up,7," Yes  this is Earth and humanity now:I am pretty sure once we go down we are going to go down like this. The way nowadays social media Earth is going on now and the way we handle Covid this is exactly how we are going to finish our lives on this planet. This is not a fiction, this is a documentary."
706,Don't Look Up,7," Hits a Little Too Close to Home:""Don't Look Up"" will divide audiences for a myriad of reasons, but personally, I found this to be a brilliant satire about the state of growing misinformation and the dangerous hypocrisies of this digital age.It's chock full of unpleasant characters and unpleasant situations, and viewers need to go-into all of it with a coarse grain of salt. I suspect many detractors of the film might be those easily persuaded by misinformation, and those, who themselves, like to ignore science and tend-to grasp onto these social life-jackets - instead of heeding the poignant and important meaning of the film - they will focus on all the negatives.The film is completely absurd, and it's supposed to be. The style, cast and absurdity just work together harmoniously. Everything about this ridiculous movie is probably not as far removed from reality as one might think. It is over-stylized, no doubt, but it's Running Man, Hunger Games, Total Recall disinformation-vibe rings true in today's world, and far sooner than many suspected. It's like Miracle Mile, Back to the Future 2, Deep Impact and This is the End, had a coma baby birthed-in the somber realities and fact-checks of Bright Lights Big City.It's not perfect. The film would have benefitted from more family development, and a better soundtrack, but any low scores can be dismissed as those who took political offense and missed the point. Cast attacks can be dismissed as well - it's comedy not a drama. Don't expect The Color Purple or Bridges of Madison County here.Good movie. Will surely find a top 25 spot for 2021. Love the extended credits. The film is clever and, imo, an important film."
707,Don't Look Up,10," honestly...:Spoken by a grumpy old man sitting on the edge of the grave, this was some of the awesomest hilarious cataclysmic armagheddonishly knitwoven colash of witt and comedy , and frustratingly hitting the truth with a reflectortelescopicaly astrosurgeons inscicion of dead and meat politicians, that on daily basis never tells much truth...neither does this film, and thank god for that because its just a brilliant build up without the god and glory precursors that has ridden us in every movie made over the topic earth no more...in fact its a ''if i live to tell'' story that has given us a new face of leonardo dicaprio, his canonade in the tv-studio is just marvelous and really reaching out for an oscar, as well as ms jennifer, they are really doing the chariots of fire in this forever and ever ending bang.So therefore, tired and sleep fatigued after a 10 hour nightshift at the nursing home on a stomatomata stummy full of porkrib x-mas dinner before leaving the presents and my pleasants, on a high that is so high , its just a spasmodic recommend."
708,Don't Look Up,8," a look in the mirror:Greetings again from the darkness. What happens if Chicken Little was right, and the sky really is falling? Writer-director, and Oscar winner, Adam McKay proved with THE BIG SHORT (2015) and VICE (2018) what occurs when he turns his unique commentary towards a target. Two questions remain. Is political or social satire just too easy these days? Has insanity permeated our globe to the degree that pointing out the lunacy has become ho-hum? McKay wrote the script from journalist David Sirota's story, and it's even more extreme than his previous work, and likely meant as a wake-up call to all of us.Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence stars as Kate Dibiasky, a student (with a Carl Sagan figurine on her desk) who discovers a large comet speeding towards earth. Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars as her professor, Dr. Randall Mindy, and we can see on his face what his calculations mean. The two head to Washington DC to inform the President of their findings. President Orlean (a nod for movie buffs) is played by Oscar winner Meryl Streep, and her Chief of Staff is Jonah Hill, who also happens to be her son. President Orlean is too concerned about her slipping rating in popularity polls to pay much heed to the scientists, opening the way for Jonah Hill to be the most Jonah Hill he's ever been. It's an outrageous scene ... yet ... it feels all too possible.Dibiasky and Mindy are so shocked and frustrated at the blow-off, they decide to take the story to the media. Appearing on the vacuous and highly-rated morning talk show, ""The Rip"", they are guided to ""Keep it light. Keep it fun"" while on the air with the entirely too-upbeat co-hosts played by Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry. At this point, Dibiasky is unable to control her frustration. This results in her becoming a social media meme, while Dr. Mindy becomes the ""hot"" astronomer - labeled an AILF. This is an obvious take on Dr. Fauci's popularity during the pandemic. Other opportunities for Mindy includes getting closer with Blanchett's talk show host, despite his wife (Melanie Lynskey) taking care of the home front.Obviously most of these characters are a bit cartoonish, but that's the point. Once the media pressures the President into taking action, an ARMAGEDDON type mission is planned, only to be scratched at the last moment and replaced by a more profitable option. Peter Isherwell (Oscar winner Mark Rylance as a blend of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk) is a tech billionaire and President Orlean supporter, and his plan involves mining the meteor for precious metals while also saving the planet.Although Dibiasky has dropped out of the 'spread the word' campaign, she's still tracking the approaching asteroid via her diet app as she hangs with a philosophical stoner played by Timothy Chalamet. It started as 6 months and 14 days, and we only get periodic updates on how much time remains. Instead, the focus is on the bumbling antics of those involved and the zany reactions of the general public. We even get President Orlean with a speech from the deck of a battleship in yet another dig at past politicians. Pop star Arianna Grande shifts her celebrity support from manatees to a hit duet with Kid Cudi entitled ""Just Look Up"", while Himesh Patel plays an opportunistic reporter-boyfriend. Also, Rob Morgan is excellent in his role as supportive scientist Dr. Oglethorpe, and Ron Perelman goes a bit off the rails as the pilot on the first mission.It's an incredible cast and what a joy to see DiCaprio in a role so far removed from his usual characters. He even gets a NETWORK scene here, and overall he makes us understand how serious the science is, and how easily someone can go off track. Jennifer Lawrence gets the film's best recurring gag, while Jonah Hill fits right in as the impetuous benefactor of nepotism. With the abundance of tooth veneers flashed by a multitude of characters, we can assume the film's dental budget was sky high.McKay uses the oncoming meteor as a stand-in for the global warming issue, and his tendency to lean heavily left does shine through. However, it's crucial to note that no one, no thing, no organization, and no affiliation is safe during this one. Whereas ARMAGEDDON took pride and patriotism of blue collar folks and turned them into heroes, McKay examines the other side which is all about feelings, discussions, social media, and popularity. He blends Kubrick's DR STRANGELOVE with Judge's IDIOCRACY (which has proven much too accurate), and delivers a disaster movie that uses an asteroid to point out the real danger ... which is ourselves. Is it too much? Too silly? Too angry? Too long? Simply playing to the home crowd? It's likely to be criticized for not being smart enough or clever enough, but seriously, have you looked around at society lately? McKay delivers loads of comedy here, and maybe by laughing at ourselves, we can find a way to improve things. His final scene is more grounded than the rest of the film, and quite touching on its own. Stay tuned for the credit scenes.Opening in theaters on December 10, 2021 and streaming on Netflix beginning December 24, 2021."
709,Don't Look Up,8," We Really Did Have Everything...:Bury your head in the sand, let the leaders take a stand. What have you got to lose, how could they possibly confuse? Your best interests at their heart, pulses shares right off the chart. And if they get it wrong, deep down you knew it all along."
710,Don't Look Up,9," I laughed. I cried. I loved it.:This film is yet another reminder to me of how very little '""critic's"" ""opinions""' ought to matter, or are actually worth in terms of steering anyone toward second-guessing their viewing choices.Don't Look Up starts out just a bit slowly, but it surprisingly grows and develops into a richly poignant picture of humanity in all its hilarity and horribleness.It is so good, I laughed, I cried, I loved it."
711,Don't Look Up,9," Don't Look Up.:Don't Look Up is kinda brilliant, at least in moments.It's satire, but not that far off. With terrific leads in two of our finest, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence. There are tune out periods and stupid silliness amidst, Jonah Hill for instance.This review's removed every time I say anything... so I'm not saying anything."
712,Don't Look Up,8," Devastating and depressingly effective political satire:As ""Don't Look Up"" (2021 release; 138 min.) opens, Kate Dibiasky, a PH. D. student at Michigan State, discovers a large comet that is heading for earth and bound to kill all life as we know it in 6 months and 14 days, to be exact. She and professor Randal Mindy are headed to the White House to brief President Janie Orlean but alas are informed by the President's son and Chief of Staff that the President is too busy that day. When the finally see the President the next day, they are weirdly unable to convey the urgency of the situation, and the President orders them to ""sit tight""... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer-director Andy McKay (""Vice"", ""The Big Short""). Here he tackles the general indifference that exists in today's culture towards things that really matter, along with providing a glimpse of the future when the next Trump-like person takes over the White House. It all makes for a strange brew that takes a while to build up, but once it is clear where this is heading, it becomes all the more devastating. And then there is the all-star cast, starting with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as the astronomers who get caught up way over their heads in the cesspool that is Washington politics, eerily reminiscent of how Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx were chewed up and spit out early in the COVID-19 crisis. Meryl Streep is the Trump-like President, a one-time Playboy nude model with zero qualifications to be President. Jonah Hill plays her son who is the White House Chief of Staff and equally unqualified. Cate Blanchett is seemingly have the time of her life as Brie, the TV anchor of ""The Daily Rip"" with unfettered access to the White House. Are you getting the picture here? And I haven't even mentioned Ron Pearlman, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, and Tyler Perry. I mean, it blows the mind. Some may say that the movie is too heavy-handed, but I disagree with that, in particular when you see how the COVID-19 crisis played out under Trump. This is dimply taking it to the next logical level, where ""Don't Look Up"" (to the sky, that is) becomes the weaponized political statement to deny there is a problem. Please note: don't leave the theater or switch the TV channel when the end-credits start rolling, as we go to ""22,470 years later"" midway in those closing credits for an update that is as hilarious as it is sad.""Don't Look Up"" was supposed to be released a year ago, but then a little thing called COVID-19 had different ideas and delayed the production of the film. The film opened in select theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I was literally the only person in the theater. The movie will start streaming on Netflix in 2 weeks. If you have any interest in a devastating and depressingly effective political satire, or simply are ae fan of anyone in the all-star cast, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on Netflix, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
713,Don't Look Up,8," The funniest and most tragic movie of the year:My Review - Don't Look Up Will stream on Netflix from December 24thMy Rating. 8/10What a surprise this satirical Comedy Si Fi Drama was for me it may well be the funniest and tragic movie this year because it has more than a ring of truth in its depiction of incompetence and ignorance.There's plenty of clever script writing by Screenplay writer and director Adam McKay
who has very successfully in my opinion covered the most talked about problems on our planet today . He manages not so subtlety to cover Climate Change, Corporate Greed, incompetent Politicians who's only motive for action on the emergencies we find our planet facing are their prospects for reelection.The film also cleverly portrays the intrusion and invasion of privacy by social media and the influence of television shock jocks and Jill's into our everyday existence .The cast includes five Oscar winners (Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep, and Mark Rylance) and two Oscar nominees (Timothée Chalamet and Jonah Hill).The premise of the story is basically the discovery by two low- level astronomers of a giant comet heading towards earth . The monster comet is large enough to destroy the entire planet in six months time. Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence ) an astronomy grad student and her professor Dr Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) set off to break the urgent news first to Washington but find the popular but incompetent President Orlean (Meryl Steep) more interested in her popularity polls and scandals within her Administration.Meryl Streep as usual is brilliant and is dismissive of the messengers of doom telling them that her administration will monitor the situation and get her experts to look into it as to alarm the American public before an election would be a ratings disaster.Leonard DiCaprio gives his most laid back performance in years as the Professor who after President Orlean's inaction goes on the top Rating Brie Evantee television talk show with Kate to break the news to the world and still the threat isn't taken seriously.Cate Blanchett as Brie Evantee almost steals the movie at times with her botoxed airbrushed impression of a plastic media Madonna with perfect implants teeth and everything else . Brie just wants Light and bright panel guests not these gloom and doom soothsayers to keep her entertainment ratings sky high.Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful as the feisty highly strung student who is ridiculed and told she needs media training when she really is the only one with any credibility or principles at all.The other stand out role is Mark Rylance as Peter Isherwell a soft spoken cold unemotional Cyber Baron who can predict anyone's life experiences including future health and life and death expectancy by the algorithms that are collected by his new phone data systems.Don't Look Up is very entertaining my only criticism is its length of over 2hours 30 minutes some smart editing could have cut half an hour off for me and made great some great deleted scenes on the DVD.I think this film is far superior to The French Despatch which has been getting much more publicity coverage. That film also has a star studded cast including Timothée Chalamet who has a cameo in this as Yule a street gang teenager smitten by Kate.""Don't Look Up.""In my view follows the path of other great satirical films like The Great Dictator (1940) Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb 1964 , The Americanisation of Emily (1964) In the Loop (2009) Election (1999) The Interview (2014) and WALL-E (2009).Some critics have said that Adam McKay's approach to this story lacks subtlety perhaps they're right but the time for subtlety is over if you care about the state of our world today . We certainly are at a turning point where good leadership and action on vital issues are missing . Greed dishonesty and self interest seem to be the prevailing qualities of our Leaders who are content to divide people with conspiracy theories and fake news to ensure their reelection."
714,Don't Look Up,10," The fact this film has so many negative reviews is the exact reason why something like this will definitely happen:Scavenging through the many negative reviews of this film, I find myself incredibly against any negative thing people have to say about this one, and honestly find myself dumbfounded it isn't receiving more support from critics. This film is brilliant, and many of the negative reviews towards it only point out the stupidity of those watching it. It's quite embarrassing to say how little people understand what this film is trying to do, or instead try to focus on its style instead of what it's trying to say. This film is a brilliant political satire, a tour de force from Adam McKay entirely capitalizing his frustration with the stupidity of those in the political system and all those it effects. It's so incredibly well written in both story and character depth, focusing on the many ridiculous decisions and scandals in the political system, as well as personalizing them for each character- showcasing on their level of ridiculousness. I share deeply in the frustration this film encapsulates, and never has a film made me feel more seen and sane in my own opinion of our current world that I simply couldn't believe how well it seemed to be reading my mind. Not to mention how well made this film is, a nearly 2 and a half hour political satire, that manages to be entertaining all the way throughout as well as brilliantly acted from veterans Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Mark Rylance, and so many more. In the end, Don't Look Up is easily one of the best films of the year for me, and might just be McKay's best film yet.My Rating: 10/10."
715,Don't Look Up,8," Much Better Than Its Metascore Would Indicate:With a Metascore of 49 at the time of this comment's writing, I expected a much worse movie than ""Don't Look Up"" gave me. I also mostly hated both ""The Big Short"" and ""Vice,"" so I believed the Metascore would probably be reflective of my own reactions. But I always go into movies wanting to like them, so here's to keeping an open mind. You might find yourself surprised.This movie is a hot mess, but the world is a hot mess, so the fact that a movie about the state of the world is a hot mess feels right. Yes, much of Adam McKay's satire and commentary is obvious and on the nose. He's not as clever as he thinks he is. But he's assembled a talented cast that knows how to sell the material, and I was mostly just happy that there's a popular movie right now that seems to be topical and relevant to the current American political culture. I've found it strange this year how few movies seem interested in addressing any of the things that are dominating news headlines around the world.Jennifer Lawrence in this movie is how I feel all the time lately. I just want to yell at people to get it together. Meryl Streep has a ball playing a female Trump, and who better to take on that roll than the woman who so famously called him out in real life and prompted one of his Twitter tantrums. Jonah Hill I wanted to punch in the face, repeatedly. And Cate Blanchett is unrecognizable as one of those insanely perky morning news hosts that the world needs fewer of.""Don't Look Up"" is about how much of our lives we spend consuming the meaningless white noise of media -- news and social -- and trying to keep up with standards foisted on us by capitalism. If a comet ever does obliterate life on Earth, I want to go out like the family in this movie did -- with a glass of wine, just chilling with the people who are most important to me.Grade: A."
716,Don't Look Up,8, Great Film.:This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2021. I'll be surprised if it doesn't take home the Golden Globe award for best Comedy / Musical Motion Picture. Nevermind the bad reviews. The people leaving those reviews are the same people that paid $17 to watch Space Jam 2 in the theaters. I highly recommend this film. NETFLIX nailed it! 8 stars.
717,Don't Look Up,6," Well-placed jabs at the society and world today...:Initially then I wasn't really overly hooked on watching the 2021 movie ""Don't Look Up"" since I wasn't really won over by the movie's synopsis. Granted, I hadn't checked out the movie's trailer, so I wasn't really sure what I would be in for here. But as friends started to praise the movie, I opted to sit down and watch it.Now, one friend said that ""Don't Look Up"" was a masterpiece. Well, I wouldn't go as far as to calling it a masterpiece. Sure, ""Don't Look Up"" was a watchable movie, and writers Adam McKay and David Sirota definitely had some good jabs at the crazy world we live in today, with the likes of a crazy president, everything being on social media, people being concerned about riches even when facing extinction and such. I found the movie to be watchable and enjoyable, sure, but it wasn't a masterpiece, nor will it become a classic movie for me.The comedy used in ""Don't Look Up"", as written by Adam McKay and David Sirota wasn't really something that had me laughing. Sure, I could see the jabs at society and the ridiculing of certain aspects of the society and world we live in today, but it didn't make me laugh.Running at 2 hours and 18 minutes, the movie feels a bit long, to be bluntly honest.What works for ""Don't Look Up"" is the cast, as it has a handful of great names on the list, with the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, and so forth.There is a good production value to the movie, and you are definitely in good hands throughout the course of the movie, in every aspects actually, from visual CGI effects, to storytelling, to camera work, acting performances, etc.Sadly, then I wouldn't exactly say that ""Don't Look Up"" is a movie that sustains more than a single viewing, as the contents to the storyline just doesn't really seem solid enough for more than a single viewing. So I highly doubt that I will ever return to watch director Adam McKay's 2021 movie again.My rating of ""Don't Look Up"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
718,Don't Look Up,8," Don't Look Up:8/10 - while there was some editing and pacing that was not 100% up my alley, I found myself finding plenty to laugh about and being more deeply affected than I expected by this well-done satire (and Ariana Grande's big screen debut) that gives you plenty to think about."
719,Don't Look Up,9," Smart  funny and powerful:I had the chance to be one of the first in the world to see 'Don't Look Up' and I didn't take it up. It looked like an overly long, overly star-studded, boring mess to me. Boy, I could not have been more wrong. This film was a treat from beginning to end.I don't think I've ever seen a film utilise extreme star-power so well. The A-list power in this film is quite incredible - and none of them miss. Some are better than others, however there isn't a dud performance in sight. Jonah Hill was probably the pick of the bunch for me. He was given a truly despicable character and made it work perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence also thoroughly impressed me.When Adam McKay has his name behind a film you know it is going to be clever, but I don't think I was prepared for just how clever this one was going to be. The whole film is an allegory for the current state of the world and it's about as well done as you'll ever see a film like this. The film is also relentlessly and effortlessly funny. I had a great time with 'Don't Look Up' and would highly recommend it."
720,Don't Look Up,8," Hilarious  Anxiety Inducing  Terrifying  and True:""At this very moment, I say we sit tight and assess.""An astronomy grad student, and her professor make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system on a direct collision course with Earth. However, no one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before it's too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up? Don't Look Up is acclaimed writer and director Adam McKay's newest feature film. He's a critical darling and master at satire and comedy. His last feature Vice proved to be divisive among critics and audiences but still got the recognition and awards hype after that battle. Don't Look Up is even more divisive and faces that same battle. Even with its mixed scores and reactions, it still has managed to appear on many best picture lists and other categories. I, for one, am all for that love. This is such a hilarious, angering, and scary film. Everything about this story is entirely possible and even reflects on modern day life. There's a large ensemble with many stars, each portraying a different type of person we'd see in a situation like this. The biggest standouts for me are DiCaprio, Streep, and Lawrence. DiCaprio plays a nervous scientist struggling with anxiety. He's really good and for me one of his best performances. At one point, he has this long monologue like the freak out scene in Network, which he nails out of the park. Obviously, he'll be everyone's favorite out of this. Streep plays the controversial president of the United States who doesn't care much and fails to look at science. Right now we know many politicians like that so it'll be easy to relate to the anger towards her. Streep has so much fun with the role and it's hard not to enjoy to some degree. Much like DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence is struggling with the anxiety of this, but is also full of rage for how the situation is handled. She's the closest to what the audience will be feeling and is easiest to relate to. Some of her character needed work on, but a great performance by her.McKay is known for his distinctive style of editing which is prominent here. It may not be his best edit yet, but it still works on a comedic level. He knows when to cut to the next scene and when to do a freeze frame in the middle of a frustrating and hilarious scene. The one thing the edit fails to do is shorten the film. This is a pretty long one. It flies by quickly, but it's longer than it needs to be. There's even a mid-credit scene which answers a question posed in the film, but honestly it wasn't needed. As much as I liked it, I was ready to be done once the credits started rolling. There's so much to take in with a topic like this. At times it feels overwhelming, and it is a scary topic to think about. It's like McKay did it too well placing all this stress on us. I'm a big fan of the conclusion. They could've handled it differently or done something safer, but they go for it. With all the fun the film has, it's not scared to be honest and show things how they are. And there is some beauty to be found. I really enjoyed Don't Look Up. There's many achievements to be found. McKay's writing is great. Nicholas Britell's score shines through. The performances stand out. It's a fun time even when it's not. It'll take a certain person to appreciate something like this. Honestly, I doubt many audiences will take a liking to it. Once you see it, you'll be able to tell. Don't Look Up drops on Netflix this Friday, so if you want to get your family together this holiday weekend to watch a film about the end of the world, go for it!"
721,Don't Look Up,8," Horrifyingly realistic:Its quite likely that humanity will be faced with a calamity in the near future that will threaten our excistence as a species. Dont Look Up explores how we would deal with a comet-implosion variant, without walking on eggshells. What scared me most was that the story was, in most part, highly believable when it came to humanities deficiencies in planning short term vs long term, and gain of the individual vs gain of the collective. So much so that I need to go get a pint of icecream to eat my Weltschmertz away now."
722,Don't Look Up,10," One Of The Best And One Of The Most Entertaining Films Of The Year:All you have to do is just enjoy it, Don't Look Up at the negative review, just enjoy it and you will be having fun as much as i have, because what an enjoyable experience i had with this movie, it's solidly cast, i mean they got everybody in here, a top A-list actor that doing an incredible job, the comedy are all works, it's not corny, it's funny, while there is some serious time and when it did it's seriously well done, it's not a too much comedy case that when it serious it didn't work and in here it works, overall Don't Look Up is simply one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the year."
723,Don't Look Up,10," Awesome and important political satire:Funny and despairing at once, this is the political satire the world (and particularly the USA and Brazil) needs in a time of anti-science, de-politizacion, panis et circensis, and huge control of everything that is public by great private economic interests. There are so many smart details that have been wisely inserted in the script that any further comment here would be a spoiler and would not be fair to its great (and surprisingly not aknowledged, as the movie is being underrated) merits. Di Caprio will probably get an Oscar by his performance, Jennifer Lawrence also goes very well, and divas Cate Blanchet and Meryl Streep shine in their so recognizable roles of TV achorwoman and president who are major players responsible for current political disasters."
724,Don't Look Up,9," Well-written and witted satirical film:I loved it from start to finish. The dark humour, the sad truth about some of our current realities, human emotions, weaknesses, ethical dilemmas, tribulations, the depth and all the meaning about existence and life along with all the details they placed in the background of every scene make it the best movie I have seen in a very long time. Music by Nicolas Britell is also a marvellous touch to the film. Absolutely brilliant!"
725,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," What it feels like to be nine years old again!:About ten months before the release of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", and without any knowledge whatsoever that a belated sequel was in production, I re-watched the 1984 original for the first time in 25 years, and together with own kids (aged six and ten). Needless to say, my offspring wasn't the least bit impressed with special effects from the early eighties, and to be totally honest, I found that my childhood favorite had badly dated as well.My biggest regret was that I couldn't pass on that magical feeling of ""discovering"" the world of horror, monsters, F/X, and ectoplasm! But when we saw publicity for the brand new ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" on television, it were my children who spontaneously asked if we could go and see it on the big screen. So, yes, with a slight delay they experienced how I felt when I saw ""Ghostbusters"" for the first time. And I felt 9 years old again, myself.Undoubtedly the best thing that could have happened to the franchise, especially after the flopped 2016-remake, was a return to the roots. The story links straight back to the original, the beloved protagonists show up (albeit briefly) and the co-writer/director is none other than the son of Ivan Reitman; - Jason. ""Afterlife"" is chock-full of gimmicks references towards the original, varying from subtle to plain obvious. The young cast members are refreshing, and fit wonderfully well in the ""Ghostbusters"" universe, but it feels even better to reconnect with the old-fashioned familiar trumps, like the legendary Ghostbusters-vehicle and - of course - the Ray Parker Jr. Theme song. The homage to Harold Ramis, one of the creators of the original concept and the only cast member who passed away, is beautiful."
726,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," Surprisingly good.:I'll be honest, after the last Ghostbusters movie, I wasn't keen on it, reluctantly I went along, and have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.Some really nice special effects, a few perhaps not so good, but that's just me being picky. A good atmosphere, and a really good pace, there's nothing slow about the film, it doesn't lull, nor did it feel overlong. It's a bit goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Great to see some old, familiar faces, if you're a fan of the original, you really will love the nostalgia vibe. Paul Rudd was awesome I thought, he stood out for me.8/10."
727,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," Finally!! A movie that's worthy of the legacy of the first two!:The first 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most beloved movies of my childhood. The second one gets critized sometimes but I think it's as good as the first. Let's forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place in the 2010's and finally focus on this one: THE TRUEST THIRD MOVIE OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. I had no hype for this one (mostly because of the trainwreck that out-of-place-2010's movie), but I felt somewhat compelled to give the benefit of the doubt and realise if my fears were right or wrong... I'll tell you this: watch this movie!It is a heartfelt, coherent and fun story that pays respect to its roots and moves forward the saga on a loving way. The plot hasn't been revealed too much because of a key reason and even if someone has been sadly spoiled, when that part occurs in silver screen is just downright marvelous. But not just that peak: the movie has several peaks. The characters were much, much better than I expected thanks to great and compelling performances. Finally we go back to some terror and some suspenseful sequences that harck back to that so damn missed old style from the eighties. The CGI is good, the soundtrack is on point and the script never dragged to me.All in: a pleasent surprise. If the story ends here, it is the best finale they ever could have pulled off. Whatever happens in the future, this movie made its work so right and so enjoyable (with a truly emotional ending in which I cried) and that's all that matters. This is a joyful, emotional throwback call that must be seen!"
728,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,9," That hit the spot especially in RPX:I absolutely loved this Ghostbusters definitely better than 2016 mess! This has everything you'd want in the series with comedy, amazing cinematography, great story I even went with a friend and he noticed a few plot holes I didn't even realize it had some; I think everything was the way it should be. So much exciting bits that are feel good and has the perfect amount of surprises. I'm glad I got to see the advanced screening and I really hope the film gets the recognition it deserves!"
729,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,7," Worthy successor:This reboot of sorts did it all right in terms of being respectful to the original, maintaining a plausible storyline, and having awesome cameos. The story was a bit slow to develop but had some cool moments and a lot of small laughs. All of this proudly sponsored by Walmart."
730,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,9," Ghostbusters the next Generation:I have to admit I had certain expectations and thought about seeing certain people/characters in this. Let's say if I was just rating the movie based on that, I probably would have rated it lower. I also missed out on the opportunity to rewatch the first two movies. But I don't think it would have mattered that much. Even a female character that had a small cameo in here, I sort of remembered her (small) part in the original movies.That being said this adds a few cool people - namely Paul Rudd and the kids. Especially the daughter and the kid who befriends her (Podcast) are a great team together. Really funny and with great respect to the movies that came before it. Maybe minus the one with the all female cast. Now I personally liked that too - if you didn't enjoy that fair enough, can't compare those two anyway.So much weirdness and comedy that works here, because of the script and because of the actors. And yes many flashbacks still - that even if you don't have the movies fresh in your memory work wonders. Also stay through the credits - one mid credits scene and one after credit scene."
731,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,9," Ghostbusters Afterlife Is A Winning Entry In The Series And One Of The Most Enjoyable Films Of The Year:Back in 1984 when big hair and neon were the norms; a movie appeared that soon became a cultural phenomenon. The movie involved a team of unlikely Paranormal Investigators and the mix of comedy, FX, and Ghosts turned the movie into a smash hit and a Pop Culture mainstay. The abundance of products that followed and the inescapable theme song and tagline soon gave rise to a sequel which while a success; did not resonate the way the original film had and thus the ""Ghostbusters"" film franchise became dormant.While a successful video game and merchandise line kept the franchise alive; the 2016 reboot with an all-female team failed to capture the magic at the box office and again put the franchise's cinematic future in question.Thankfully after several delays due to the Covid 19 Pandemic; ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" has arrived and is the worthy sequel that does justice to the original film and sets the stage well for future cinematic exploits.The film follows a down on her luck mother named Callie )Carrie Coon) and her children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard); and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), as they are forced to move to a dilapidated farm in rural Oklahoma following the passing of Callie's estranged father and her subsequent eviction.A series of unexplained earthquakes clues the smart and precocious Phoebe that something is up and with her new friend Podcast (Logan Kim), and teacher Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd); help her uncover her connection to the original Ghostbusters and the abundance and significance of the gear that her Grandfather has left on the farm.Things soon take a turn for the worse and despite skeptical locals and the emerging danger, Phoebe, Trevor, and their friends have to battle the forces of evil to save the world.The movie takes its time getting to the action and spends plenty of time establishing the characters, their motivations, and their relationships with one another. There are abundant homages to the original film; some of which are very subtle and clever but never seem gratuitous or tacked on.The film also does not rely on the FX to tell the tale as while there are some solid effects in the film; this is a character-driven tale and the new cast works well with some surprise guests who pop up throughout the film.Director Jason Reitman; son of the Director of the original film; clearly knows and loves the material as he not only helped craft the story but deftly weaves a new tale into the franchise which also fits well with the first film and does not attempt to reboot but rather continue the franchise.There are two extra scenes in the credits that you will not want to miss as not only are they great fun; but also tease of future adventures to come.The film also has a few touching moments that caused some unexpected emotion from the audience at our Press Screening and helped establish ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" as not only a winning entry into the series but also one of the most enjoyable films of the year.4.5 stars out of 5."
732,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,6," It was entertaining:Much better than the reboot but doesn't even come close to the first 2. The original had a very ""flavorful"" cast and I think that's what made them so good. Like, had they cast this crew in the original films I highly doubt they would have been as good as they are.In the end I still enjoyed it but it seemed for like a Fan Film kind of tribute than an actual 3rd installment."
733,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,10," FANS REJOICE! coming from a die hard Ghostbusters fan  this is EXACTLY what we were waiting for. an event film:Ive been waiting for this movie for two years. So my expectation were at another level. I had the pleasure to attend the advance screening and I have never experience anything like this. This movie, with its die hard following, make the viewing experience an event film. The energy was electrifying from begining to the last credit. And everyone stayed to take pictures of each other. Its exactly the movie we needed to continue the Ghostbuster legacy.Jason Reitman did not dissapoint and makes his father proud in this new Ghostbusters. And can you spell nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. Did I forget to mention nostalgia? All of us Generation Xers who experienced this film at the cinema in 1984 and 1987 will be brought back to our childhood once again. I can't stop ranting about this film. It was that good. I am going to watch it again tomorrow and this time Im seating my ghostbusters wardrobe! Don't go, run, run, run to the cinema and experience this once in a lifetime event from the biggest to the smallest fan. This is a movie for generations to come. Congrats to the filmmaking team in bringing us back to the original experience. It was wonderful!!!!"
734,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," Ghostbusters: afterlife........ 7.5/10:Massive fan of the original and the sequel was good too , i did not like the remake from a few years ago , but this is a very good watch , take the kids or just go yourself for a bit of nostalgia .....!!!!!!!"
735,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," Reitman's valentine to the original comedy horror classic will make you feelin' good.:GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE (2021) *** Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Logan Kim, Celeste O' Connor, Bill Murray, Dany Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, JK Simmons, Olivia Wilde. (voices of : Josh Gad & Shohreh Aghdashloo). Filmmaker Jason Reitman, son of executive producer and director of the original comedy horror classic, returns the franchise true to form in this valentine to the team of paranormal exterminators with the Spengler family retiring to their estranged paterfamilias Egon (the late, great Harold Ramis) where his granddaughter (Grace, in a winning and often uncanny turn as the famed comedian) discovers her grandfather's plans to stop the return of Gozer the Gozarian to return for another shot at destroying the world, while in the process of uniting her family in their new Mid-west environs. Reitman, who co-wrote with Gil Kenan the chock block of Easter eggs screenplay that wisely incorporates its source material with its new cast (the weight of the legacy rests well on the slender yet able shoulders of Grace, the heart of the film). Fun mix of visuals and much welcomed extended cameos make for a heckuva night at the cineplex."
736,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,9," Incredibly heartfelt reboot:Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an incredibly heartfelt reboot that's extremely heartwarming, emotional and funny whilst treating the original with respect. It also has plenty of satisfying callbacks, even if it's narrative is basically the same as the original.Mckenna Grace gives an incredible lead performance and Paul Rudd, Celeste O'Connor, Logan Kim, Finn Wolfhard and Carrie Coon all give great supporting performances and have strong chemistry.Jason Reitman's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced. The CG is consistently excellent and there's some impressive practical effects too. Both the music by Rob Simonsen and the soundtrack are both really good."
737,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,4," Script by way of marketing department...:Why do they need to dumb everything down?As someone rightly pointed out, in the original it took 3 men to take down Slimer. In this it takes one little kid who has just found a proton pack to take down a more dangerous ghost.I loved Ghostbusters 1 and 2 as a child, they didn't need to dumb things down back then to appeal to me.Honestly it just left me depressed at the lack of creativity these days, everything feels like a cash grab first and a script second.Pretty much all the characters could have been dropped from the movie apart from the young girl and it wouldn't have made a difference.There's massive plotholes, it's just a sad affair all round.I wish Dan Akroyd would have got a good 3rd movie, sadly this isn't it."
738,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," Once a Ghostbuster  Always a Ghostbuster...:If you like the supernatural, the weird and ghostly paranormal, often fantasise of phantoms, apparitions hold you ransom; if you're looking for some fun, using spectral shooting guns, blitzing wraith-like demon dogs, into ectoplasmic fog; if you're a little sentimental, got the VHS as rental, remember 1984, did your thing on the dance floor; who you gonna recall, spend two hours having a ball, guaranteed to make you smile, busting ghosts with such great style."
739,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,4," Ghostbuster KIDS!!!:The Ghostbusters reboot 'Ghostbusters: Answer the Call' featured all female Ghostbusters. Now with 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' we have ghostbuster kids.... Ugh, give me a moment to recover...Ghostbuster KIDS!! Honestly! The idea - or sight - of 12-year old kids acting as ghostbusters is just not interesting or believable. Seeing them face to face with ghosts, demons, goblins, etc while they just stand their making jokes while zapping them is not exactly my idea of fun. This movie is for kids.Considering the excellent visual effects in the original 'Ghostbusters' way back in 1984, the visuals in 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is nothing to write home about. It's good, make not mistake, but compared to what they've accomplished almost four decades ago, it was nothing special.'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is also very slow. I mean, this film truly moves at a snail's pace. The original film was so much fun and excitement, whereas this film was pretty much about kids making jokes. The 'love interest' between Trevor and Lucky felt so forced and annoying, while Callie and Grooberson could have allowed for a far better love interest. Then again, as mentioned, this is a children's movie, so I guess they opted for a teen love interest. Pfff!!Oh, no, look, Marshmallows again!! These marshmallows felt like Gremlins-wannabes, or even Minions wannabes. This is the part where I just shook my head in disbelief...The film will no doubt garner a fan base due to the appearance of the original Ghostbusters - Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson (and even Harold Ramis in ghost form...). As for me, unfortunately 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' did nothing for my senses. There's a lot of noise and light flashes during the film's climax; I mean jeez! Oh, I suppose I should lighten up, sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.... ugh, no, scrap that, I didn't like this movie at all. Ghostbuster kids....pff!!!!!Would I watch it again? No."
740,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,4," Completely lacking the magic and charm of the 1980's originals:STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulCassie (Carrie Coon) and her sons Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (McKenna Grace) fall behind with their rent and other debts, and retreat to a rural farmhouse they inherited from Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), Cassie's dad and one of the original 'Ghostbusters.' Here, they will discover their true connection to the original group. Cassie forms a partnership with Grooberson (Paul Rudd), a teacher at the rundown local school who shows the kids violent 80's horror flicks, like Cujo and Child's Play, while Phoebe strikes a friendship with a kid who calls himself Podcast (Logan Kim.) Everyone is set on a collision course with the resurrection of Goza from the original film.In spite of all the inevitable publicity and hype that surrounded the release of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, I couldn't will myself to drag myself out to the theatre to go and see it. Despite having a notable appreciation of the original 1980's films, I had been underwhelmed by 2016's all female reboot and it just felt like another one of those franchises that had become over-saturated and overblown by its own fan base. But I finally had to see how it held up to those original films. And while I didn't expect it to match the quality of those classic films, I still didn't expect anything as flat and underwhelming as this effort from Jason Reitman, son of original director Ivan Reitman.In an age where only established franchises tend to get a shoe-in, it's understandable with a film series with the cult following this has, that there may be some who would want to see how they would fare to a new generation. But while it's undeniably affectionate towards its source material, right down to having a number of bit part original cast members (including Annie Potts as snarky call handler Janine Melnitz) making an appearance, it's all just completely unengaging, at least twenty minutes overlong and with cardboard characters you feel nothing for. With central characters so weak, you await the anticipated arrival of the original line up right at the very end, but contributing little more than to show their age, aside from a poignant finale where a CGI version of OCM Harold Ramis appears, after his real life death in 2014. His death also ties in with the plot.Overall, this emerges as little more than pointless, spurred on by nothing more than slushy nostalgia for the original. There's some effective light relief, little light touches like mini Stay Puft Marshmallow Men jumping off K Mart shelves, things like that, but generally, if this is the 'Afterlife', I'd prefer to live in limbo. **"
741,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,5, Not good sadly:The movie is cringe acting is ok. Just another franchise that makes children the hero which I honestly don't like. Felt like an average dc movie. Sadly did not get me one bit. Paul Rudd was easily the best part of the movie. The trailer made it look like Paul Rudd was starring but he was barely in the movie. I am really disappointed.
742,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,2," Painful:I was the kid who dressed up as a Ghostbuster every year on Halloween, saved up pennies for the action figures, proton pack and the glow-in-the-dark trap, and begged my parents to bring me to the sequel even though I ended up having recurring nightmares of Janosz's glowing eyeballs. I cherished those movies, and Afterlife seems geared exactly toward my particular level of obsessive fandom.Which is what makes this whole ordeal such a supreme disappointment. Instead of anything even half approaching a decent movie, we have the umpteenth subversion of a childhood memory by filmmakers who are trying, in vain, to recapture the spark of an original success, and falling on their faces. Whether it's the relentless perversion of the OG Star Wars trilogy, the Crystal Skull disaster, Blade Runner, Matrix, Scream, and the last Ghostbusters - the constant classic franchise revisitation schemes are mostly really annoying and a big fat waste of my money. Honestly, the only person at present time I would trust with a franchise addition is George Miller. And maybe James Cameron. And whoever was behind Paddington.Afterlife made me cringe. At every level, I was cringing. I was on board with the intent - and the saving grace might be that it doesn't feel like a cold and calculated cash grab by a studio. It does seem a genuine tribute, and a nostalgic vehicle, helmed by the talented son of the original filmmaker. But then it falls into the trap of being a hokey nostalgic vehicle by the son of the original filmmaker, rather than attempting anything fresh and new with the material. Obviously Jason Reitman has proven himself as a great filmmaker in his own right, and made one of the greatest films since the turn of the century, which is Juno. But Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a different beast, and to me, he failed in his mission to direct a big scale supernatural action film, fill it with irreverent comedy and make it feel anywhere near as effortless or purposeful as the original. This movie is a long and difficult slog through seriousness, cheesiness, and weird meta self-referencing in a way neither of the other Ghostbusters ever would have dared to be.I could get into the plot and details, but really I don't even want to. If you've seen the first two, you're basically seeing the same thing except it takes place in a rural town, it's much more diluted, and it's starring kids. The same music, the same creatures, the same ideas, the same tag lines - even the same sound effects - only hokier and less funny, and all thrown in through a Stranger Things filter. And the hyped up reunion between the original Ghostbusters should have been a joyride and one of the great moments of this movie, and yet I had to close my eyes when it got to those scenes, because I didn't want to ruin the original any more than I had by staying awake through this one.This movie just embarrassed me. And made me sad. I don't want to leave a Ghostbusters movie sad again, so I actually give up on this, and will settle for revisiting the first two annually again. I liked that arrangement anyway."
743,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8," The Original Ghostbusters are Back!:Not only does the ""Ghostbusters"" sequel reboot ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" (*** out of ****) recapture the whimsical hilarity of the original movies, but it also amounts to a family affair. Jason Reitman, who co-wrote and directed ""Ghostbusters Afterlife,"" is Ivan Reitman's son, and Ivan directed the two Bill Murray ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Furthermore, Ivan also served as a producer on the reboot. Apart from Harold Ramis, who died at age 69 in 2014, and Rick Moranis (alive but retired), everybody else reprises their original roles. Despite quibbles, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is more faithful to the franchise than the previous, uninspired, gender-flipped ""Ghostbusters"" (2016). Jason Reitman has kept the family legacy intact with ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" Anybody who enjoyed the supernatural shenanigans of the first (though not necessarily the second) ""Ghostbusters"" should relish this reboot. Reitman and co-scenarist Gil Kenan provide airtight continuity between ""Ghostbusters 2"" (1989) and ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" A refreshing, young, first-rate cast, lighthearted CGI visual effects, and polished production values distinguish this 124-minute, PG-13 rated franchise update. The Reitmans have shown good taste in their reverential treatment of the Harold Ramis character. Appropriately, they portray Dr. Egon Spengler as an apparition now rather than an actual person. Don't rush for the exits when the end credits roll or you'll miss deleted footage of Harold Ramis from the 1984 ""Ghostbusters."" One of the delights of ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is neither Kenan nor Reitman have tampered with the backstory of the franchise.Predictably, though it boils down to ""Ghostbusters: The Next Generation,"" Reitman's ""Afterlife"" focuses on Dr. Egon Spengler's family. Unfortunately, Kenan and Reitman crank up their reboot with Egon's demise. During an explosive opening gambit, Egon meets his monstrous match in a humongous phantom that has been hibernating in a nearby defunct mining cavern. Later, we learn Egon abandoned his colleagues, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray of ""Stripes""), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Ackroyd of ""Doctor Detroit""), and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson of ""Machete Joe"") after their 'ghostbusting' business went belly up. Vanishing into the sprawling eternity of Oklahoma, Egon bought a secluded house in Summerville and prepared for a showdown with Gozer. Worshiped as a deity by ancient civilizations, Gozer was the Ghostbusters' prime adversary. Egon not only absconded with their iconic Cadillac ambulance Ecto-1, but he also took their equipment, including the Proton Blaster Packs, P. K. E. Meter, and the ghost Traps. Now, holed up in a dilapidated white farm, in the middle of nowhere, Egon has wired up his entire property so it resembles a backyard version of Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. The tragedy of Egon's death is mitigated somewhat by the deafening fireworks during this encounter. ""Black Hawk Down"" Supervising Sound Editor Perry Robertson also provides nerve-racking jump scares when our protagonists wield the Proton Blasters. During the grand finale, when the original cast seals the continuity gap with ""Afterlife,"" you'll know Jason Reitman got it right. Meantime, the amusing miniature-sized Marshmallow Men in their cute sailor suits are back creating pandemonium, too.Dr. Spengler's daughter Callie (Carrie Coon of ""Avengers: Infinity War"") is a single mom with two kids. She has an unruly 16-year-old son Trevor (Finn Wofthard of ""The Gold Finch"") and a precocious, 12-year-old daughter Phoebe (Mckenna Grace of ""Malignant""), and they are all about to be evicted from their apartment for late rent. Conveniently, Egon dies, and Callie inherits his Summerville farmhouse. Naturally, Callie hopes the sell the place. Once she arrives in Summerville and beholds the property, she resigns herself to staying until she can dig herself out of debt. Callie enrolls Phoebe in summer school and meets Phoebe's teacher, Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd of the ""Ant-man"" movies), who runs a relaxed, laid-back class. Grooberson shows his students old horror movies like ""Cujo"" (1983), while he ponders a mysterious outbreak of earthquakes in the general vicinity. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge of geology. Phoebe is the spitting image of Egon. She wears his nerdy spectacles and has his curly hair. Predictably, Grooberson and Callie hit it off while the kids explore the farmhouse. Phoebe finds Egon's P. K. E. Meter beneath a chair. Later, she rummages through Egon's secret basement laboratory, while Trevor discovers the Cadillac ambulance Ecto-1 parked under wraps in the barn. The automotive genius of the family, Trevor gets the Ecto-1 running in no time. Phoebe and her summer school pal Podcast (newcomer Logan Kim) take a Proton Blaster out for field trials. In the film's first, slam-bang sequence, Phoebe and Podcast accompany Trevor on a joyride in the Ecto-1. Phoebe sits in a seat that slides sideways out of the right rear passenger door. When they cruise into town, they spot a ghost named Muncher chewing up a fire hydrant. Basically, the kids destroy parts of Summerville in their efforts to capture Muncher. Imagine Callie's alarm when the police notify her about her children's antics. Waiting for Callie to bail them out of jail, Phoebe uses her one phone call to chat with Dr. Raymond Stantz. Little does Phoebe realize her father's colleagues are bound to descend on Summerville.Incredibly enough, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" would have qualified as a good movie whether Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Ernie Hudson had reprised their roles. After Callie and her kids move into Egon's old quarters, the film adopts a ""Goonies"" (1985) vibe. Basically, Phoebe, Podcast, and Trevor behave like ""The Goonies."" As Phoebe, Mckenna Grace steals the show with her charismatic performance. Although Slimer is on hiatus, the CGI ghosts are every bit as outlandish as they were in the classic ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Olivia Wilde appears in an uncredited cameo as the evil Gozer. Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts have cameos, too. A goofy séance of sorts, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" gives this supernatural franchise a new lease on life."
744,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,9," Great fun:Single mother Callie and kids Trevor, 15, and Phoebe, 12 are evicted just as Callie's estranged Dad dies and leaves them his place, a creepy gothic homestead in an Oklahoma backwater. Trevor gets a job at the local diner, where he can make moon eyes at cute and friendly local waitress Lucky. And scientist prodigy Phoebe connects with teacher and amateur seismologist Gary, keenly researching the inexplicable local earthquakes. She also becomes friendly with Podcast, a kid who makes podcasts about inexplicable scientific phenomena and constantly talks in 3rd party linking sequences. Phoebe discovers a lab in the basement where her grandfather worked. And she discovers that her grandfather was Egon Spengler...I liked the all-female Ghostbusters of several years ago, but that has been put to one side: this movie is effectively Ghostbusters 3 because it follows on in a number of ways from the original movies. The trailer shows us Dan Aykroyd reprising Ray Stantz and Paul Rudd as teacher Gary.But I'm pleased to say that the kids, and in particular Mackenna Grace's Phoebe, carry this film. The story is good, the cast are fine, the script is good fun with some lovely lines, the callbacks are effective, and the film has heart. There has been criticism that the film overdoes its fan service, but I felt this was integrated well into the story (contrast Solo, for instance)."
745,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,9," A pleasant surprise!:Just saw the movie in avant-premiere here in Belgium. Had a blast, and my daughters (11 and 17) really loved it. Sure, there's quite a bit of fan-service but I was very happy to see they kept the style of the previous movies, it has a dash of The Goonies combined with the charm of the 80's movies and the ending is just great. Really did not expect it to be this good, but man am I happy they did what they did. Great movie, just plain good fun like in the good old days. Go see it!"
746,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,," Nostalgic  comic sequel to a great classic. Have fun in a theater.:Just because I was alive for the original 1984 Ghostbusters doesn't mean you young'uns won't enjoy it as much as I do. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an entertainment for the entire family: It has scary ghosts, nerdy kids, young teen romance, adult romance, and nostalgic special effects as well as equipment like a tricked-out Ectomobile, a portable nuclear particle accelerator, and a ghost trap, to name only a few to delight kids and adults, who may fondly remember analog.Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) as the science-friendly 12-year-old and her siblings, grandkids of an original Ghostbuster, move to a remote Oklahoma farm, the dilapidated ""Dirt"" estate. They encounter ghosts, as to be expected because gramps didn't quite finish the ghost-busting job from '84.The ghosts are a bit goofy (more like out-of-control dogs and marshmallows), and the stakes may not be earth-shattering, but the fun they have trying to capture the critters is a high-spirited chase coupled with a subtle lesson about the importance of family, legacy, and cooperation. The relevance of this classic-based tale is in the notion that working together is an answer to beating back intruders (COVID, anyone?).Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Harold Ramis appear (appropriately Ramis as ghost since he has left us in death to write about them somewhere), not enough but just enough to link the past to the present. This fourth iteration, and certainly the best of the sequels, will make you chuckle, maybe cry a little, scare you a tad, but never bore you.As adult romancers, Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd) and Callie (Carrie Coon) are charming and clueless enough for us to beg for more time with them. Finn Wolfhard (star of Stranger Things) as brother Trevor (just enough of Timothee Chalamet in his look) and the gifted comic kid, Logan Kim, as Podcast will make teens, and us all, quite happy with their shenanigans.A sweet comic atmosphere prevails over this successful sequel. I hope it's enough to get you back to the theater where hosts serve up comfy seats, knockout sound, and fantasy relief from the pandemic."
747,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,1," Boring  Cliche  Pandering to Nostalgia  and yea. Just Boring.:Wow, was I underwhelmed. I thought I would be watching a comedy...like the original two Ghostbusters. I thought I would (imagine this!) actually laugh! But...no. I just felt like I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, which is not a good feeling.What's with all the raves? Do people feel they have to say all this good stuff? Or were they watching a completely different movie from me?This installment feels like it's made more for kids than adults. Are the first two movies dated? Of course, they are. They were made in the 80's. But so what? Why is that so terrible? In a way, that's what adds to their charm. They were cheesy and funny and sarcastic in a clever and adult sort of way. They weren't made for kids...although I am sure kids still enjoyed them. My own daughter likes them, and trust me, she wasn't around in the 80's.But this! Wow! First of all, what is with that mom? Worst Mother of the Year Award anyone? What a horrible mother! She's getting evicted and makes a joke about it...then spends the rest of the movie trying to act like a kid, herself. Totally irresponsible. Oh, I guess that's supposed to make her seem ""cool,"" right? Wrong.Then there's Paul Rudd as the ""teacher."" I put the word teacher in quotes since he just shoves bad movies in for kids to watch instead of actually teaching. Is this supposed to be funny? Because it's not. And if I were a teacher, I'd really be turned off. I was turned off enough as a parent. It seems as though writers have forgotten how to be truly funny. They write a person acting irresponsible and juvenile and think that adds humor. But it doesn't.And the old guard guys from the original movies showing up? I just felt sorry for them. How embarrassing. Making a movie as a ""tribute"" to someone, instead of focusing on making a movie that's actually entertaining? What a mistake. Funny thing is, I think Harold Ramis would agree with me! He would not have been pleased with the lack of humor in this production.So, there you have it. Sorry. I was really looking forward to watching this thing, too. I get it...young people will probably like it more because it feels more ""current."" More ""Stranger Things"" like. Not dated from the incredibly ancient 1980's. Okay, fine. Maybe that's the case. But let's just be honest about that and admit that this movie is made for younger people ONLY. And also...this movie is NOT a comedy. And while we're being honest, it's also tedious. Incredibly tedious."
748,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,4," What's with the kid-ifying of every modern reboot?:When I watch the modern IT remake it works because it's as violent and crazy as the original.But this is just... ""Okay, our all-female reboot didn't work so let's make it a little girl this time and do a whole lot of references to the original"".I'm sure it's great for fans of the original but if you haven't seen it - it's not. It's mostly boring, aimless, and wraps up real quick near the end.Actors are good, music is okay, effects too, but from a writing perspective I expected something like a comedy, something with weird ghosts and... not a cringey teen movie with insuffrable characters."
749,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,6, Better than average but not great.:IGN gave us at 9. And it's overrated here too. It has a fun campy feel of the original. But it's not as good as these ratings and in the end I felt like it wasn't that much action scariness and suspense and it was all over so quick.
750,Zack Snyder's Justice League,9," A huge improvement over the 2017 cut:I don't want to discuss the Machiavellian machinations that led to the butchery cut from 2017 and then to this one seeing the light of day - suffice to say that I am not hopeful for the future - yet I am grateful for them leading to me getting to see Zack Snyder's cut. Other than being way too long, it was a pretty perfect film. It would have been a much better business decision to split it into two films and getting twice the money from cinemas than to cut and reshoot it into stupidity.After watching this cut I knew why things happened, what the motivations of the characters were, including the villains, Superman's lip didn't make me cringe, new characters and story ideas have been introduced and I am hopeful for the DC Universe for the first time in a long time. Easter Eggs galore! And it also had a nice end scene that foreshadowed a possible continuation, but also gave enough so you understand what it could have been even if no film is being made of it. It's not a one minute Marvel post credit scene, it's a full on subplot about the future. Hell, it made me want to see more of Jared Leto!Is it perfect? No. There were some scenes that I would have gladly had edited out: people bursting in song like in a Bolly film, people climbing stairs, Lois Lane talking to Clark's mom, Lois Lane talking to a random street cop, Lois Lane standing still thinking, etc. The character of Cyborg's dad was also weak, even if I really like the actor.Bottom line: I thought that the 2017 cut had a bunch of characters that were not explored or otherwise pointless. The Snyder cut fixes all of that and adds meaning to everything everybody does. It's not mindless fun like the 2017, but has a shape and a place in the world and would have given me hope in the DC Universe if I didn't know only AT&T's desperation brought it to light."
751,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," Zack Snyder's Justice League:There was a time I would go to the cinema, watch a movie like Superman II or Raiders of the Lost Ark. I would think I really liked that movie, could had done with another 30 minutes added on to it, what a ride.As I get older. Now when faced with the 3 hours long, The Avengers: Endgame. All I can think is will no one think of my bladder.There are countless examples of even 2 hour long movies nowadays where I think the director could had easily sliced 30 minutes off.This brings me to Zack Snyder's Justice League. All 4 hours of it.I planned to watch this over several days and to my surprise I did it all in one day.Although Justice League (2017) has Zack Snyder credited as the director. The film was largely reshot by Joss Whedon who delivered the final cut at 2 hours. Snyder has not even seen the movie.Fan pressure got the Zack Snyder cut released. It looks like everything Snyder shot is in it, some with better special effects added and Snyder even shot some new footage.This is a more coherent version. I remembered just how rushed some of the scenes were in Justice League and the accompanying music by Danny Elfman.In essence Whedon's rewrite and reshoots created a monster with two competing visions. Which then had to be heavily edited for a shorter running time.Snyder has been allowed to give his cut room to breath. The main beneficiaries are The Flash and Cyborg who have more of a backstory and utilised better here.Ray Fisher who played Cyborg has been pretty critical about how his character's part was reduced in Justice League and how he disliked the atmosphere created by Whedon.Steppenwolf also fares better in this movie with improved CGI. In Justice League I thought he was just a generic CGI villain.There are still some downsides. In the opening hostage scene with Wonder Woman. She could had disarmed the baddie as we can see she moves very fast. Instead Wonder Woman lets him reload his gun, all so she can blast him from the side of a building. How many people did the falling debris injure?When The Flash is running around near the speed of light. Cyborg is just standing there doing nothing, not even looking behind him to check if Steppenwolf is there. In fact there is a bit too much standing around in several action scenes when the mother box is the most important item to protect.Superman is still the casualty in both versions. A reduced role for the Man of Steel who has to return from the dead.There is no doubt in my mind this is the better version of Justice League. However the real challenge would had been could Snyder had delivered this movie with 90 minutes shaved off."
752,Zack Snyder's Justice League,9," This is the Justice League movie we deserve:As a life long comic fan, DC characters are more close to my heart than Marvel characters. The first making of this film was just disappointing. It seems like there are bunch of idiots sitting on the WB executive positions who have no vision at all. The first film was literally incomplete. This one tells the full story and I must say nicely. This is the movie we, all the fans wanted and deserve."
753,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," Long  but worth it.:Zack Snyder's Justice league is an excellent movie. It is however 4 hours long. And I never got bored watching any of it. It's a masterpiece and testament to Synder's vision for his movie that we should have gotten to see back in 2017. He fixed the problems with Justice League (2017) and improved upon them, must watch for any comic book fan."
754,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," I'm glad that they found a way to resurrect this superhero film:While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films."
755,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," It leaves you asking for more!:Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize.
Honestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film."
756,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8, Wow... so much better than the one that went to theaters:Zach Snyder's original version is 1000 x's better than the one Joss Whedon put in theaters. DC made a huge mistake not trusting Synder.
757,Zack Snyder's Justice League,9," Incredible  far better than previous cut:Zack snyder's justice league is far better than theatrical cut, in every way you can think of, steppenwolf is an actual threat now, his cgi is great, he has a clear goal, but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters, Snyder did each hero justice, and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing, Wonder woman is nothing like what we've seen in ww84, she is a valiant warrior and badass character, I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2, he is an absolute great villain, and junkie xl music is really epic and great, overall 9/10 for this movie, I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motions
NOW, it's time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE"
758,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10, Felt literal goosebumps.:No words can describe the experience. Seeing all the struggle come into life makes it amazing. Hundred times better than the theatrical cut.
759,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," Much Better Movie:This version is so much better than the originally released movie. At first, I didn't understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released, but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didn't add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League, go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original."
760,Zack Snyder's Justice League,9," The superhero collaboration movie should be atleast 3 hours long:The longer they are, the more time they get to set up the story The pace is perfect The stories of each character is perfectly timed Nothing feels rushed and the dark theme just ups the game Justice has finally been done to the reputation of justice league"
761,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," Superheroes Unite!:Yesss, thank you Zack Snyder!
THIS is the movie the DC heroes deserved...
And the fans as well!It's an amazing continuation on ""Man Of Steel"" and ""Batman V Superman"" and the story is splendid this way. Character arcs, worldbuilding, awesome effects...
Note to Warner Bros: let Snyder continue this franchise.
He really knows what he's doing!"
762,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," ALL HAIL ZACK SNYDER:The original film was 2 hours long, this version comes in at 4 hours!From start to finish the film is literary a new film with more story, more action, more everything!Epic, amazing and can't wait for the sequel!4 years of wait finally ended..."
763,Zack Snyder's Justice League,," 4 Stars for 4 Hours of Average.:Zack Snyder's Justice League, retells the story of reviving superman and uniting heroes in one team to defend the planet from an ancient off the world evil, Darkseid.The whole movie is focused on the fight between the JL and Darkseid henchman, Steppenwolf. Yet it still have some good fight scenes aside from the huge number of goofs that you can spot left and right from the get go...you can simply - spot the fake gun silencer falling down while the terrorist at the beginning of the movie moves his hand - and this is the LEAST to say about the amount of goofs and silly spotted mistake allover the place with no spoilers.Let's talk technicalities without mentioning many details, The casting choices...I know this won't ""stay down"" for most but I'll say it as it is...Clearly they are settled for some weird reason with their casting choices but this is for them to troll the real fans with and for me not to watch, Superman I believe is a good choice, batman well he's ""OK"" (although I believe superman can be adjusted in the post production to look TALLER than Bruce Wayne but hey this is just me) but seriously Wonder woman ?! No blue eyed, let's just say ""well built"" actress out there ? I'll leave it at that and I bet comics fans get my drift, a short flash ?! I don't care how tall is the actor in real life but the bad directing and ugly cinematography makes him look way shorter than the others in almost all scenes. It's not a huge deal but an eyesore for true fans. But when it comes to Lex Luthor and the Joker casting well...this is what I call a sad joke! The DC casting generally nowadays is sad and all over the place! It's like the decision makers for the movies are teen girls!... From casting of the suicide squad to justice league not to mention the casting for the upcoming batman which is a laughable joke to say the least. But hey this is for them to screw up and for me to either not watch or free stream at best! ""Not Worth A Penny"".The story is a bit off at various points along the movie, the plot is very linear...a problem present itself then gets solved right away, every step is very convenient like it was written for children only. You can feel that the director is trying very hard to come up with a Very different version from the original but failing to stand out in my opinion. He tries so by mainly shoving more characters that fans like with no regards to their role or reason to exist in the movie.The CGI is good at moments, silly and laughable at others and a big WOW when it comes to the extremely stupid adaptation of the Flash! The Character itself, is Not the nerdy scientist guy we know, the lines makes him pretty much a stupid drunk person with nothing useful to add! The CGI is laughable and fails to show a proper mechanism of the Flash. It made me feel like he's swimming and sometimes jumping long distances in a puddle of goo! Not running super fast at all, even with the comics logic when flash moves in hyper speed his surroundings slows down but this does NOT means he slows down as well ! He should either move in a speed relative to our normal perspective or even faster but clearly the director lacks the brains that he force slow motion in every flash close up that we completely thrown off the concept of the character superpower.The so called ""Aquaman"", aside from the obvious ""ugly"" casting choice, most of his late fight scenes are WAY WAYYYY off. There's NO water in the surroundings, why do the filmmakers shove him in the fight scene jumping/flying around like a male wonder woman! Seriously wtf.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a mindless Ok to watch flick and may be enjoyable for some if you can spare 4 hours to kill without literally having anything else to watch. But far from standing out on any level."
764,Zack Snyder's Justice League,7," please continue...:This movie is significantly higher quality. Almost everything they took out was for the better. Almost every change was for the better. The story makes sense. There are legitimate characters with arcs and everything. The visuals were beautiful, the music was beastly. And it is TRULY epic.The only reason i didn't give this a higher score is because, simply put, it's too long. I was never bored. And i always advocate for the artists (directors) creating art without studio interference. But while the original justice league is one end of the spectrum with studio interference up the butt, this seems like the other end, where the director is a bit overindulgent. Many of the scenes were completely unnecessary to the story and some even felt like deleted scenes from a dvd extra.Again, i was not bored, but rewatchability comes into play when i rate. I definitely want to watch this again, but the 4 hour runtime will significantly reduce repeat viewings. Somewhere in here, there is a 3 hour and 15 minute perfect cut which i would rate 8/10. (1 viewing, 3/21/2021)
SPOILERS
In the original the, the mother boxes were just a useless MacGuffin that I didn't care about, now the mother boxes are actually a huge part of the story. In the original the villain was the most bland cookie cutter villain ever, now I actually knew why he was doing what he was doing. In the original they took Superman to General zod's ship to revive him with the mother box and none of that made sense to me but I just went with it and didn't ask questions. Now it makes way more sensethe scenes i imagine should be taken out are some of the scenes with martha and lois, the martian manhunter stuff, and some of the epilogue. I thought the epilogue was cool, but it was out of place here. And it makes it worse if they're not continuing this storyline, which as of now they are not."
765,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," 8:It was the longest movie that I've seen in my entire life. Despite being 4 hours length it didn't feel like that, all that time just flew away. That's main point which shows that this film was interesting to watch. I've seen first Justice League and now seeing this I can see some similarities but there are more differences in a good way. I've enjoyed plot, it was easy to follow, interesting to watch, it kept your attention whole time. Can't say a lot about acting it was on point, really good, main actors did great job (yeah, there are some awkward scenes but just few). The main concern I have is effects. As a viewer I saw that there was a lot of slow-mo or speed- up scenes to make CGI smooth (that's my guess) but that just made some scenes less realistic. I really admire some special effects, colors and details but some scenes have major problems. I would say this movie deserves about 7.3-7.4/10 but, as this is the best film, that I've seen, so far in this year, I raised my mark to 8. I would encourage to watch this movie for comics, DC or even Marvel fans because it's really good."
766,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," Great art:The story of ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and it's perfect. Character buildup, plot, humor, climax, emotions in the movie is so great. It's a sight for sore eyes."
767,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," This was so good from beginning to end and had a nice pace between storyline and action scenes.:Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) is a movie the Mrs. And I watched the night it was released to HBOMax...the entire 4 hours. Man we loved it. The storyline focuses on a premonition given to Batman that tells him a world conqueror is on its way to Earth and he needs to assemble some rumored and identify companions to face the invader. Follow his crusade while meanwhile, the world conquerors minions have already arrived to Earth and set the stage for an epic showdown. This movie is directed by Zack Snyder (300) and stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Ben Affleck (Gone Girl), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Amy Adams (Doubt), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers) and Diane Lane (The Outsiders). My description does not do the storyline justice. The execution of the villain and how impactful he was as a foe was excellent. We loved Steppenwolf. The vastness of the Amazonian island in the opening sequence was a great kickoff to the movie. I liked how Aquaman was portrayed in this version as well as the ripple-effect of losing Superman, for his family as well as to the overall planet. This was so good from beginning to end and had a nice pace between storyline and action scenes. We are fortunate Snyder came back and gave us this version and this is one of my favorite super hero moves I have seen in some time. This is almost a perfect film that I'd score a 9.5/10."

769,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," Awesome movie.:I loved the movie from the beggining to the end.Just like Ray fisher said,I was hoping that the movie doesn't end. The begging scene was mind blowing, liked that scene very much. Unlike 'the Justice League' the movie show every hero is best at their own thing, make us love every charecters.
Thanks Zack and the whole team."
770,Zack Snyder's Justice League,8," ""There is no us without him."":If you know the history of this film, you'll know it's not a sequel to 2017's ""Justice League"", but more a replacement of it. At four hours, double the run time of the earlier picture, it delves more deeply into the back stories of The Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg/Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), which is commendable, since they didn't get their own full treatments like Wonder Woman and Aquaman. The story here revolves around the the three mother boxes that the main villain Steppenwolf seeks to bring together to usher in the Unity, which would bring about the destruction of the planet. If you grew up a DC comic book fan in the Sixties, you would take the formation of the Justice League to have occurred among super-hero friends who all knew each other, so it was a bit of a disconnect for me to see how tough a job it was for Batman (Ben Affleck) to get some of the others to join him in his mission. Also, with Steppenwolf reporting to two masters, both DeSaad and Darkseid, you had to wonder at times why Darkseid himself wouldn't just step in to do all of his own dirty work instead of relying on intermediaries. The comic book stories take the time to drag out all these relationships over time, but in a compressed format, even if four hours, it just makes me wonder. I had to wonder too, why Steppenwolf made such a big deal about locating the third mother box on Earth. After all, the second mother box was also located on Earth, just under the ocean in Aquaman's realm. It would have been preferable I think for Superman (Henry Cavill) to have a larger role in the story, though his reuniting with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and his mother (Diane Lane) allowed for some poignant moments that offered some of the best dialog in the picture. Ultimately, the Zack Snyder cut offers an epic story line that fans can enjoy in chapter segments if the four hour run time proves a bit antsy, giving fans what they missed out on in the earlier version."
771,Zack Snyder's Justice League,9," So Snyder's Cut:Most Critics said that there is no difference between this version and that whedon crap version , but yet we know where's that opinions come from.
Snyder's Cut was complete and more believable than the whedon version and more importantly the last three sequences first the last fight with flash back in time , second one luther breakout from arkham and the unique one ""The Nightmare"" and when i saw LETO as joker that's far from what i saw in suicide squad crap , brilliant job done from snyder because he pull that acting from leto and that's where a real director can show the QUALITYlast word : i'm gonna wait for JL 2 yeah i'm gonna wait ...."
772,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," What in the hell was that:I cannot believe WB ever thought any of what i just watched was bad material. zacks version is better in literally every way possible, it's a 4 hour movie but it doesn't feel like it, never drags and i actually was disappointed when it ended because i wanted more. the pacing is incredible, the story is coherent unlike the 2017 cut. the music was insane, junkie XL outdid himself especially with wonder woman's theme; i don't understand how zack can make WW this fierce badass but she was a joke in her own movie. You can tell the difference of when a director respects the characters given to him; every single one of these heroes was a joke in whedon's cut especially batman and cyborg but zack gave batman and everyone else the respect they deserve. the only flaw is that it ended, thank you snyder for this universe and thank you to all the fans who made it possible"
773,Zack Snyder's Justice League,4," Overlong and unnecessary:If I had to describe ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE in one word, it'd be ""tiring."" By the end of this four-hour-long saga (yes, you read that correctly), I just wanted to take a nice long nap and give myself a break from the constant CGI battles, overuse of slow motion, and all-over-the-place storyline.Am I saying the Snyder Cut is a bad movie? No, of course not. This film is still miles better than the Frankenstein's monster of ideas that was 2017's JUSTICE LEAGUE. Snyder directs this movie with his typical stylistic and over-dramatic eye, and many scenes would have fallen flat with somebody else behind the camera. The storylines of Cyborg and The Flash are also much stronger here, and both characters are far more interesting as a result. However, I still don't think the movie ever justifies its existence other than satisfying the fans who have been clamoring for it on Twitter.Much of the flaws of the 2017 version are still here -- some of which have even been boosted by the four-hour runtime. The plot still feels incredibly disjointed and messy: the story finally comes together with one coherent goal about 3/4 through the movie, and by then I was just waiting for it to end. Somehow, I felt as though nothing really happened throughout this movie other than setup for future projects, which is quite infuriating given both the overlong runtime and the long-standing hype. The writing is also really tacky at times, with certain stone-cold serious lines making me laugh out loud (Wonder Woman saying to a little girl who just survived a terrorist bombing ""You can be anything you want to be"").I feel bad for raining on everyone's parade, but it was difficult for me to get through this. I still see the objective value in Snyder making this and attempting to right the wrong that was done to his film by Warner Bros. In 2017, but I don't think it amounted to all that much. C."
774,Zack Snyder's Justice League,10," Finally  it's been set straight:Gonna keep this short. It was worth the wait, despite the DCU's cinematic history and it's inferior ""Josstice League"". It's 4 hour runtime wisps by with its perfect pacing and attention to detail. This is definitely the definitive verison and Zack Snyders vision as intended. 10/10."
775,Jurassic Park,10," A rare breed of film seldom seen anymore: a true masterpiece.:'Jurassic Park (1993)' is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10"
776,Jurassic Park,9," A time when I thought dinosaurs were real:My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond's investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond's two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen's corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex's cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to ""save"" the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says ""must go faster"" so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I'm surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that's not what I'm going to do"". I responded that with ""I have much darker plans for you"", I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It's timeless and I can't wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9/10"
777,Jurassic Park,10," A Groundbreaking  Heart Stomping  Dino Sized film:In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy"
778,Jurassic Park,9," With a bazillion other reviews  I'll keep this short.:By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please."
779,Jurassic Park,10," The Movie to define a Generation.:If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you. I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!
Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you."
780,Jurassic Park,," exciting:JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment."
781,Jurassic Park,10," Still great after almost a quarter of a century:After a worker is killed in an accident at the dinosaur theme park 'Jurassic Park' owner John Hammond calls in experts Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler as well as mathematician Ian Malcolm to visit it the park and clear it to open to the public. 'Jurassic Park' is no ordinary theme park; it is on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica and it contains real dinosaurs! It is explained how these have been created by extracting dinosaur DNA from blood in mosquitoes preserved in amber. The first ones the visitors see are harmless herbivores but they are told that the park also contains some of the most famous carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor; something that both excites and concerns the scientists. After an introduction the visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, and the company lawyer take part in a tour of the park. As they travel things go wrong for two reasons; a tropical storm is heading for the island and, more importantly, a corrupt company employee as set up a computer program that will turn off various security systems including the electric fences that protect the guests so he can attempt to steal dinosaur DNA sell it to a competitor. Once things do go wrong those on the tour find themselves fleeing for their lives following a T Rex attack on their vehicles while those at the park headquarters try to find a way to get the systems working again. Inevitably not everybody will get out alive.Like most people who watched this in the cinema when it was new I was amazed by the special effects that brought long extinct creatures back to life; watching it again over twenty years later and they still look fantastic. If one didn't know that dinosaurs died out millions of years ago you could be excused for thinking you were watching real animals. While these were the films big selling point it would have been for nothing if we didn't also have a good story acted by a fine cast luckily we have both. The action isn't rushed; a significant amount of time is spent introducing all the main characters and explaining the characteristics of the various dinosaurs. This means that by the time everything goes wrong we care about the protagonists and know which characters to look forward to seeing die! There aren't a huge number of deaths and those there are aren't overly gruesome; the goriest moment is the brief sight of a severed arm. Despite its UK-PG rating it is surprisingly intense at times and has plenty of genuinely scary moments. The cast do an impressive job; Sam Neill and Laura Dern impress as the two leads and there are also fine performances from Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeff Goldblum and Bob Peck. Child characters are often annoying but Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are pretty good as Tim and Lex; especially the latter who is a great screamer! Overall I'd defiantly recommend this to anybody wanting a genuinely exciting film that is suitable for most ages."
782,Jurassic Park,9," Dazzling spectacle  with the dinosaurs as the scene-stealers:I personally really like Steven Spielberg, and I like his films, especially Schindlers List, Jaws and ET:The Extra Terrestrial. While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
783,Jurassic Park,9," Some things dead  should stay dead:As a kid I so well remember my younger brother and those dinosaur toys he had as a kid. We've seen dinosaurs in film before going back to the silent version of The Lost World. But they were never better shown than when Steven Spielberg made Jurassic Park out of Michael Crichton's novel. These put other screen dinosaurs to shame.Through some cloning billionaire Richard Attenborough has succeeded in recreating those long dead creatures of the past and now has a theme park, Jurassic Park. All the herbivores and the carnivores of the past are now alive. But when you come right down to it, Attenborough has just become another Dr. Frankenstein. Some things dead should stay dead.At least that's what scientists Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum try to tell him. And I have to admit Attenborough does have state of the art security. But he has a greedy employee in Wayne Knight who has made a secret deal with some rival tycoon. His greed brings the whole operation to disaster as dinosaurs start running amuck.The tyrannosaurus rexes and the raptors are what captured the imagination of the public when Jurassic Park was reached. Up to that time dinosaurs when they were on screen were slow moving behemoths. Spielberg's dinosaurs have some speed to them, far more like what they were in the Jurassic Age.I have to say I loved Wayne Knight's performance in Jurassic Park. He's such a loathsome creep, but also a real putz. The end he meets is truly just.Jurassic Park and its successors and imitators have brought about a renewed interest in paleontology. That's always healthy in any society, an interest in the sciences.My brother Daniel loved this film when it came out. As will you."
784,Jurassic Park,10, Perfect:This film alone justifies the entire existence of cinema. Magical.Spielberg is alive and directing. John Williams is alive. I only ask a single thing: just one more creature blockbuster. Please.
785,Jurassic Park,10," My favorite Movie:Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies like, ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's List"". But on June 11 1993. He released my favorite movie, ""Jurassic Park"".What make's this movie great is the special effects. They really brought the Dinosaurs to life. It also had some nice suspenseful scene's. Also, the acting was good. Sam Neil does a nice job as Alan Grant and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. Plus, the theme song was incredible. Sometimes when you listen to it, it feel's like you're going to cry.In the end, ""Jurassic Park"", is a great film and it is definitely worth watching."
786,Jurassic Park,10," A child's fantasy  but the world's nightmare.:When man messes with the secrets of nature, they are going to live to regret it, that is if they live to see it. ""Think of it as a big cow"", scientist Sam Neill tells the kids he's trapped in the jungle when a herbivore visits the tree they are sleeping in a tree that the friendly dinosaur grabs a ton of leaves from to make a huge salad. But even big herbivores can crush a small human with their gigantic feet, and then there are the carnivores which come in all sizes, and even a small one can devour a full grown man in a matter of minutes, bones and all.If the shark of ""Jaws"" was frightening, the T-Rex and other species recreated at Richard Attenborough's mysterious island compound that he has set up as a possible amusement park. But there is no amusement when every species of meat eaters go after human prey.Impressive and cinematic, this was a huge blockbuster that came the same year as the film that won Steven Spielberg his very first Oscar, ""Schindler's List"", and it is a total contrast from that now classic drama about surviving the worst real event in modern history. ""Jurassic Park"" is about survival, too, and one that we pray never comes true with human involvement.Between Neill and Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Attenborough, this is pretty star-studded. The kids get grating at times, but the mixture of tense action and humor makes for a thrilling film. Once again, composer John Williams creates a classic score, adding to the many he's already done for a Spielberg film.For me, this is a reminder why science needs to keep its corrupt fingers off of the mysteries of nature. Dinosaurs are fascinating, but there is a reason why civilization has thrived while they became extinct. I look at this as just one possibility of how they lived, how they looked, and possibly how they interacted with whatever human beings looked like when these not always friendly giants roamed the earth."
787,Jurassic Park,10," The best dinosaur movie there is; one of the best movies in general:I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more."
788,Jurassic Park,," One of the greatest films ever made.:I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)"
789,Jurassic Park,8," A milestone in its time:The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.After I first saw this movie in the theatre 24 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole ""Walking with ..."" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.Thus with the ""shock value"" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as ""5-star"" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family."
790,Jurassic Park,10," Classic for a reason:I'm no great fan of Steven Spielberg. He makes films that should interest me, but all too often ruins the experience by being overly sentimental. Take his WAR OF THE WORLDS remake as a case in point: it had the potential to be a fantastic movie, but thanks to the ridiculous plot twists I can't ever bring myself to watch it again. However, JURASSIC PARK, despite containing an overload of sentimentality, manages to be a simply great movie, a classic in fact, thanks to an overwhelming amount of elements that work.Michael Crichton's story is fresh (if you overlook the fact that it's Westworld with dinosaurs) and inventive. Okay, I wish Spielberg had made this film for adults rather than kids – complete with the graphic bloodshed of the original novel – but then I guess I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema at the age of 12 and been hugely influenced by it. The cast is splendid, particularly Sam Neill, one of those rarely-seen character actors who really deserved the big time success he enjoyed with his role here. Goldblum is even better, although much underutilised in favour of the redundant Laura Dern character. Watch out for Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson in memorable bit parts and try to avoid the annoyingly precocious brats played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards. Bob Peck's big game hunter, straight out of the pages of a H. Rider Haggard novel, is a complete scene stealer.Of course, this is one of those rare movies where the actors come second to the special effects, and the mixture of CGI and animatronic models is still breathtaking to this day. The scene where the T-Rex escapes is hands down one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema, ever. Okay, what follows is occasionally ridiculous (the car dropping down the tree scene) and involves kids running around too much, but it's still the kind of breathlessly exciting movie that there aren't all that many of.I still remember feeling a little bit jealous of how this movie popularised dinosaurs in the mainstream. As a kid, I'd always loved the creatures and owned loads of books about them, but after JURASSIC PARK every kid in the world fell in love with them and it was never the same. I ended up a little jaded, as I'd wanted to stay in that little niche on my own. Anyway, I digress: this is an outrageously good family movie, one of those films with a little bit of everything in it for everyone, and one I can wholeheartedly recommend and enjoy over and over again."
791,Jurassic Park,," Still a land mark in film making:It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?8/10."
792,Jurassic Park,10," The best classic sci-fi action my number 1 personal favorite adventure Dinosaurs movie Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride:Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the best classic science fiction action adventure movie one of my personal number 1 favorite adventure Dinosaurs films of all time. It is Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride. It has great visual effects, breathtaking story, it has heart and soul it defines my childhood. I grew up with the film I used to had a t-shirt with Jurassic Park. I love the film to death it is the best one in the franchise it is my number 1 favorite film In the franchise we can say it is the best animal family movie for everyone including kids.It has wonderful score from John Williams, great cast it has Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The film is based on a novel from Michael Crichton the book come out 1990 the movie come out 1993 and Michael Crichton helped writing a script for the film. It was brilliant direction from Steven Spielberg about scientists tampering with nature, the film is also mixed with horror in which velociraptor try's to eat Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) who finds a Ray Arnold's arm (Samuel L. Jackson). The effects are top notch, the CGI for 1993 is still good I love the design for T-Rex and the velociraptor fighting on the end. I love Brachiosaurus in this movie I love those dinosaurs so much.The story is original a group of scientist cloned dinosaurs they about to open a amusement park for people lead by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who invites on a island of Isla Nublar, four people paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to gave him their opinions. All three disagree with John Hammond that tempered with nature is wrong and only a lawyer agrees with John because he thinks the park will make a fortune. One of the employees Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is planning to steal dinosaur eggs and during a preview tour, he causes a security power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. Dr. Grant stays with the kids Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) alone in the park and he has to return to resort complex, meanwhile John Hammond, Dr. Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ray Arnold and Robert Muldon (Bob Peck) trying to get the power back.I love Dr. Alan Grant I love the character he was a great hero, great adventurer great paleontologist and great researcher. I love Sam Neill his character was writen on his skin. I love the kids Tim and Lex Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards they were great kids who were Hammond's grandchildren I love them. The most heart in the film was Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) because she cared about the animals she was a great human been she wanted to help a sick triceratops which I love the character so much. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) I really miss the actor I love his character I love what he try to do I love him to dead it is a shame he is no longer with us. I like Dr. Ian Malcolm in this movie he wasn't annoying in this movie Jeff Goldblum was likable and decent.My favorite scenes in the movie are: The T-Rex chases the jeep down the road with Dr. Sattler, Ian Malcolm and Robert Muldon in an exciting car chase of an action sequence. I love in which Dr. Grant and kids are climbing over the fences and the fences are electricity high voltage the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence great breathtaking scene ever. I love that scene. I love the action sequence in which Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of velociraptors inside the main kitchen and fight for their survival. Another favorite scene of mine is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her. I really miss this movies and I miss my childhood. My best friend from my childhood was a huge fan of this film he collected comic books, action figures and he borrowed me his VHS tape of this film because I never seen the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film."
793,Jurassic Park,9," Such a classic.:This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow."
794,Jurassic Park,10," A genre staple gets a much deserved re-release in 3D and IMAX.:Perhaps more so than any other director in film history, Steven Spielberg has locked into that most desirable niche of movie-making: pleasing everyone at the same time. When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park on a secluded island, and he wants to offer a sneak preview to a select group of individuals (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern). Of course, the prehistoric attractions don't much appreciate being detained for the amusement of others, and begin to cause havoc as soon as they take the opportunity to escape from their enclosures. An extremely imaginative plot adapted from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, it sets the foundation for a rip-roaring battle for survival.For many viewers that first saw Jurassic Park as pre-teens, the greatest thrill will come from appreciating, to a greater degree, the way the film deftly builds suspense. Cleverly building up to the revelation of the 'meatasauruses' by stunning us with the visual treat of cuddly herbivores, when we do finally meet the imposing Tyrannosaurus, it is one of cinema's most exhilarating set pieces, only to be topped some time later by the thrilling cat-and-mouse game in the kitchen.It is a testament to the incredible skill of the animatronics and visual effects team that the film's most dated quality is the occasionally cheesy dialogue that burdens Lex and little brother Tim. The dinosaurs are clearly the main event, but the undercard of Jurassic Park spares no expense, with touches of class including Dr. Grant's personal evolution from a child apathist to a fully-fledged family man and a miasma of Shelley-esque criticisms of man's innate desire to play god while drunk on the illusion of total control.To call this the movie event of the year would be to make the grossest of understatements. Experiencing this glorious monument to total escapism on the world's biggest cinema screen is simply mandatory for anyone was has ever felt goosebumps in a theater. Bring your kids- they'll never forget it.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
795,Jurassic Park,10," My all-time favorite movie going experience:""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.""Since we're only a couple of days away from the premiere of Jurassic World I wanted to share some thoughts on one of my all time favorite movie going experiences (perhaps my favorite). I was only 12 years old when Steven Spielberg released Jurassic Park in 1993 and from the second the movie started I was at the edge of my seat. From the breathtaking and groundbreaking visuals, to the outstanding cast, and the magnificent score everything about Jurassic Park made me fall in love with it. The dinosaurs had come to life before my very eyes, and Spielberg masterfully wrote a thrilling script that had me sweating for two full hours. I can never forget the thrills I felt during the T-rex scene and that final climax with the velociraptors in the museum's kitchen. I remember thinking there was no one cooler than Sam Neill's Alan Grant and I wanted to be Tim Murphy (played brilliantly by Joseph Mazzello). The rest of the cast was also amazing: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson. Many will consider Jaws as Steven Spielberg's most terrifying film, but for me it was Jurassic Park because I got to experience it on the big screen and it was my first memorable experience at a theater. I had seen many other films that had made an impact on me prior to this (Star Wars, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and E.T.) but none in a theater, so Jurassic Park holds that nostalgic value and it will forever remain one of my favorite films. It also became the first film I went to see again at a theater because I couldn't get enough of this world. There are so many quotable lines from this movie and many memorable scenes, and I realize it is going to be impossible for Jurassic World to live up to that standard but I am still highly anticipating it while I relive some of my childhood memories with Jurassic Park. It's a masterpiece."
796,Jurassic Park,9," Hold on to your butts  it's now in 3D. Jurassic Park is Rex!:I don't really like paying for movie tickets just to watch old movies converted into 3D. I can watch the 2D version at home, with no cost. Still, Jurassic Park is one of those movies. No matter, if you watch it in 3D or 2D, your jaw will dropped seeing the realistic lifelike dinosaurs on screen. I had watch this movie over and over again over the years, and it always is a blast to watch. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the 1990's. Jurassic Park is the story of a theme park on a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs that turn amok, and those left on the island, must find a way to escape. Jurassic Park shows the potential danger of technology. Owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) spared no expense making this park, but in an attempt to increase efficiency and save money, wants Jurassic Park to be able to operate with a minimal number of staff run by weasel Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson). Therefore, he has the park designed to be operated almost entirely by a huge computer system that automates virtually all of the park's systems and functions. What he doesn't know is that Dennis Nedry, has been paid off by one of InGen's corporate rivals to steal dinosaur embryos. During the theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton in 1990, the beginning of the information age, where everything was getting computerizing, but few knew the dangers of it. People are still suffering from computer theft even today. Another danger of technology is how men shouldn't play God by cloning extinct animals. The movie mirrors the lesson teach in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Still the science in the film might be far-fetch. The idea of bringing dinosaurs to life after 65 million years is unlikely even with future technology. Soft tissues that contain DNA are nearly impossible to preserve and the chances of extracting enough DNA of a single dinosaur to produce one are slim. Still, it's interesting. If it does happen, you know that chaos will come close in hand. This serves as an example, where technology fails to keep us save, and prove disastrous. Still the movie fails to explain why Hammond didn't use all the staff that he has. They were paid to be there, so when the hurricane comes to the island. Surprising the film footage of the storm was Hurricane Iniki that hit Hawaii where they were filming. So that was really a hurricane that being shown there. Anyways it would make sense to have the staff there to make sure the island is secure, but he send them off the island for something that was a merely a small storm, keeping only two computer guys and a game hunter? What? The movie would be a little bit more interesting if only we, the audience got to see the whole staff in danger as well, like Michael Crichton earlier novel, 'Westworld' that has a similar plot. Instead we only see a small group of dinosaur experts try to escape the island rather than a whole island in chaos. This small group is leaded by paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Harrison Ford was first ask, but he turned down the role of Dr. Alan Grant as people might mistake the character for Indiana Jones. In my opinion, Sam Neill was perfect for the role. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The kids are bit annoying as they do idiotic stuff or have stupid dialogue. Most of the movie, I really wanted them to get eaten by a dinosaur. It make sense for all those characters to be in the island, except Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician that the lawyer brought in. While Jeff Goldblum is given some of the best lines in the film; the reason why his character is there is still a question to me. He doesn't know anything about dinosaurs. Still, I do like his flirting with Chaos Theory. The movie differs from the book in a bit. I'm glad Steven Spielberg took out the Hupia theme from the story. It wasn't needed. Different characters end up dying, while other characters that supposedly died in the book, live in the film version. Surprising the whole character of Tina was written out of the film. The film has amazing visual and special effects by the use of animatronics. The film is noted as one of the first movies to use CGI. Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics might look like 8 bit type cartoon quality but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of dinosaurs. He decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. In my opinion, the stop motion they did film wasn't too bad as well. The early CGI, this film use is surprising is better than a lot of modern day CGI that low budget companies use. Jurassic Park's soundtrack compost by John Williams is truly anthem of our childhood. The music is spectacular. Not a lot of people know this, but while Steven Spielberg work on Schindler's List, he placed post-production in the hands of George Lucas. In many ways, you can see Luca's influence in the film. It was while supervising post-production on this film that George Lucas decided that technology was good enough to begin work on the Star Wars prequels. The movie is a must- see movie, not only if you love dinosaurs, but also if you love Sci-Fiction. Give it a try if you haven't saw it already. An adventure 65 million years in the making is waiting for you."
797,Jurassic Park,," Great Movie! One of Spielberg's best:Wow! That's about all one can say about this movie. The first time that I saw it I was mesmerized. The movie looked so cool and hey, it actually had a good plot. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"
798,Jurassic Park,10," The king of the monster sci-fi flicks  with the top director and athor in the field:""Jurassic Park"" clearly deserved all the awards it received for special effects - visual, sound and editing. The entire production team contributed to one of the best sci-fi films ever made. And, without a doubt, it's the best monster sci-fi film ever made well into the 21st century. I can't think of another creature feature that seemed so real. While CGI was obviously very important in making this picture, the realism has to be attributed as much to the fantastic models of the dinosaurs created for the film - especially the main villain, T-Rex.This film took the development and use of animatronics to a new level. These are robotic types of models able that can be moved, for sequences of shots that make them seem to come to life. The effect, with actual creations is much more realistic than CGI. People can see videos of the creation and making of T-Rex online. People can see videos of the creation and making of the big guy online.The basis of the film, and a succession of sequels and all sorts of spinoffs, of course is the 1990 novel of the same title by Michael Crichton. Crichton (1942-2008) was a Harvard Medical school graduate and M. D. But he never practiced medicine in favor of a flourishing, driven writing career. He was the master storyteller of sci-fi thrillers, especially plots around medicine and the physical sciences. Of his 26 novels, 13 have been made into films. He also wrote several original screenplays, and directed and produced films. His first smash film success was ""The Andromeda Strain"" of 1971. Jurassic Park is by far the most successful book and film, but his books by 2020 had sold more than 200 million copies.Crichton and Stephen Spielberg became friends while working on this and other films. While having great directing talent across many genres, Spielberg has had a particular flair for sci-fi films. The Jurassic Park series are the most prominent, but others of his productions include ""Firelight"" of 1964, ""E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" of 1982, ""Twilight Zone, The Movie"" of 1983, ""Gremlins"" of 1984, ""Back to the Future"" of 1985, ""Innerspace"" of 1987, ""batteries not included"" of 1987, and sequels of some of these and more.All of the aspects of this film are excellent. And all of the cast are superb. The plot is simple and while many, many more have reviewed and commented on this film, I decided this late just to give the recognition to the author and director, both of whom have a repertoire of films that will last and be enjoyed far into the future. And as for seeing this film, anyone who has not yet seen it on a theater screen should watch for any such opportunity in the future. This is the type of film that misses the grand scale of the subject on TV screens, even the large flat wall screens. Dinosaurs, especially in ""Jurassic Park,"" and its sequels, should be seen on the big screen for maximum enjoyment."
799,Jurassic Park,9," Stomping  chomping dinosaur action par excellence.:I was raised on a diet of dinosaur and monster films, and so when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurassic Park in 1993 promising unbelievably lifelike prehistoric reptiles, I was at the head of the queue (metaphorically speaking of course, since I pre-booked my tickets!!). Needless to say, Steve's amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the park's computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.The film's plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic 'water-ripples' as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industry's top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (I'm still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds)."
800,Free Guy,8," Actually really good.:I did not expect that, this was chosen literally for convenience, I'd seen the trailers, and didn't think I'd enjoy it, it is so good. I'm sometimes hard to please with films, but this is definitely worth seeing. It's bonkers, it's crazy, but it's funny, and actually pretty moving at times, a more heart warming film then you'd think it would be.Some pretty amazing special effects, it is never boring at any stage.Ryan Reynolds is terrific, and fans if his will appreciate him being here, he's great, as is Comer.I didn't expect it to be this good, 8/10."
801,Free Guy,9," The feel-good film for summer 2021 with a typically hilarious Ryan Reynolds:One glance at FREE GUY, the newest big budget offering from Hollywood's favorite action-star/comedy master Ryan Reynolds, will cause most to approach with valid skepticism. The plot seems like a cheap knockoff of films like Ready Player One or even The Matrix, but made in a crude fashion to make more money at the box office. The actual movie, however, could not be further from the worst estimates. Not only is FREE GUY constantly hilarious due to Reynolds and an inventive screenplay, and not only is this possibly the feel-good event of the summer, but it also has a considerable amount of thought put into the meaning of its premise and places a mirror in front of modern-day video game culture.To put it simply, perhaps the main reason this movie comes together so well is because of Ryan Reynolds' constant charisma and hilarity. Most of his dialogue is clearly either written by him or created by him on the spot (I have no idea how he hasn't received a screenwriting credit for this and the Deadpool movies), and the film is that much better as a whole because of it. He also interacts with the other actors in the film very well, including Jodie Comer and Joe Keery, two underrated actors who prove here that they aren't just one-time stars from their respective television shows (Killing Eve and Stranger Things). The ensemble combines to create the most consistently funny movie of 2021 so far.However, this movie isn't just hilarity and crazy antics, although it could easily get by on those aspects alone. FREE GUY has tons of heart and authenticity despite its virtual reality-based plot, and is about very human emotions such as disillusionment, the feeling of being trapped, and, of course, love. There are times where the heartwarming aspects of this film resemble a charming romantic comedy and others where it gets so existential that it almost feels like The Truman Show. It never dives quite as deep as the latter film, but the fact that it even has the guts to include these themes made this easygoing big-budget movie a far better watch for me. Sure, the last thirty minutes are very cheesy and contain a lot of clichés, but the buildup is so solid that it earns some dumb rom-com moments near the end.FREE GUY is worth going to see because it is one of the few quality films right now that increases one's faith in human nature. Lately I feel as though I have lost my faith in humanity with all that is happening in the world, so it is refreshing to get a movie that feels confident in the human experience. Maybe I'm looking too deep into the message of FREE GUY and maybe it was conceived just so Ryan Reynolds could screw around for two hours, but either way the price of admission is well worth it for an amazing time at the theater.A-"
802,Free Guy,9," Free GTA:I reckon the future may hold a game like this for us ... where the AI is so developed, that NPC (non playable characters) live their own life in games, make their own decisions and so forth. Having Ryan Reynolds starring in this ... well it is a genius move to say the least. I called it the Ryan Reynolds show and I'm quite certain no matter if you like this or not, in this regard you will agree with me.Having said that, there are other characters who give it their all, especially our female protagonist. Her counterpart in the real world is as overdrawn as he can be ... Taika does a really good job ... he is actually more comically and one sided that most of the characters in the game he developed ... well others did for him.And then you have the ally in the real world ... a good guy who has to be convinced and who has to come around ... and who you may never feel as much sympathy for as you did for Ryan Reynolds. Even when you figured the ""twist"" in his character and where the story leads ... apart from the revealing a scam thing.Having said all that, the movie boosts a lot of cameos ""in game"" and also real world ... has references galore (not just to GTA and apparently Fortnite, have not played the latter yet, but also to movies and persons/movie characters/franchises)! This can be so much fun if you spot them - not sure how some will play out in say a hundred years ... but you can never tell or guess the impact of something like that.The movie is insane and a lot of fun and has even a moral message in it of sorts. You can detect some philosophical ideas in it too ... what is life and all that. But the main thing and the surface are there to entertain you ... so be entertained and have fun with this!"
803,Free Guy,8," Free Guy is popcorn movies at its best.:Ryan Reynolds is guy, a NPC living in the game Free City. He met Jodie Comer's character and discovers things about his world. There's also a real life part of the film, with Joe Keery, Jodie Comer again, and Taika Watiti.These are all great names. And with amazing direction, an original idea and great execution is what makes Free Guy such an endlessly entertaining film.This is a short review because i want to let you see it yourself and be amazed by how good Free Guy actually is.Did I enjoy it? Yes. Is it a flawless masterpiece? Maybe not. Did I smile throughout the whole film just because how fun it is? Hell yeah."
804,Free Guy,8," Didn't see that coming:Blue shirt Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is an NPC that does the same thing everyday. When he sees a female player he goes out of character to meet her. It seems the program has an AI algorithm that allows the characters to develop. This turns his world upside down.There have been films with characters in games interacting with humans. Tron was the forerunner to all of this. There were numerous low budget films and who didn't fall in love with ""Glitch."" This film was fresh and funny. And like all great films, it was also a love story."
805,Free Guy,7," A cute idea...though the first 20 or so minutes is by far the best.:For the first 20 or so minutes of ""Free Guy"" I was enthralled. As I watched the film on HBO Max, I called my wife over the watch and we both laughed and enjoyed the film. However, as the film progressed the movie lost some of its momentum...and this slowed to a crawl later in the movie. Why? Well, the same problem with ""Free Guy"" is the same with ""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"" (incidentally, both starring the likable Ryan Reynolds)....plot. Or, more like it, too much plot. Both films did great jobs world building but after that, they both seemed to insist too much on a plot involving a baddie...which is very formulaic but also reduced the magic from the story. I would have rather seen more of the exciting world in both...and less baddies.The story is an odd one...one that is similar to combining ""The Truman Show"", ""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"", ""They Live"", and an online game that plays a bit like ""Grand Theft Auto""! And, the main character, Guy (Reynolds), is an NPC (a non-player character) in a massive world created for online gamers. However, something odd happens.... Guy begins to develop consciousness...and it is driven home when he dons a pair of sunglasses. Suddenly, he can see power ups, health power ups and more! What's next? Well, a baddie...and one whose motivations were vague.Overall, the film is still worth watching...it's good. But the momentum which is going so fast when the film begins just can't be maintained through the course of the film.By the way, there are no extra scenes. When the movie ends and the end titles begins, the story is over...just in case you're tempted to keep watching."
806,Free Guy,6," Virtually a good movie:Much like the virtual world in which the people of Free City live, the movie Free Guy is virtually a good movie. Most of the elements of a good movie are there, but it feels artificial, and you can tell that something is off. It's entertaining enough, and I appreciated the pop culture references and action sequences, but frankly I preferred this version of the story when it was called The Lego Movie."
807,Free Guy,8," How likeable is Ryan Reynolds!?:This movie was much better than I expected. It was enjoyable throughout, paced well, and cast exceptionally. The major strength of this movie is in how damn likeable this cast is. I'm not sure anyone could have done this other than Ryan Reynolds. I'd recommend a watch."
808,Free Guy,7," fun guy:Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) is his best friend. He's actually an NPC (non-player character) in Free City, an online video game. He goes through every day doing the same thing and getting robbed multiple times. One day, he spots Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer) and his world view expands. In the real world, she is Millie suing Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing her code. She is in the game trying to find proof of that theft.It's a good idea but it's Ryan Reynolds who makes this good. He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game. I get that it makes it easier but it makes no sense. All that is a little besides the point, it's Reynolds and he's the fun guy."
809,Free Guy,4," That's not how video-games work  my guy.:'Free Guy (2021)' feels as though it's been made by people who have never actually played a video-game. It's the cinematic equivalent of those pre-rendered mobile game adverts that pretend to present gameplay but don't actually represent the game they're trying to sell at all. Though there are a couple of interesting ideas centred around the A. I. that makes Reynold's Guy able to go against his code, the piece just doesn't do anything with them. It doesn't really make sense and there's no semblance of cohesion or believability to the game that makes up most of its runtime. I mean, who is 'Free City' for and what do you do in it? It's not PvP from the looks of it, but everyone freaks out when an NPC actually presents a challenge to a player. God forbid a player gets killed by an enemy in a game, right? However, the fact that it lacks a proper sense of logic isn't its biggest issue, although it is undeniably irritating that a movie which is supposed to celebrate video-games clearly doesn't understand them and also partakes in the kind of banal 'gamer' stereotyping that perforates pretty much every piece of traditional media about the subject. No, the biggest issue is that, for me, it simply isn't fun. It's quite the opposite, usually. The amount of cringeworthy moments are nearly innumerable and its message is incredibly hypocritical considering that it lambasts big-budget games which are fuelled by mindless chaos and exist only to make money from a target audience that their developers clearly don't respect but it's a big-budget movie which is fuelled by mindless chaos and exists only to make money from a target audience that its creators clearly don't respect. Ryan Reynold's on-screen persona, which is essentially the same in every comedic film in which he appears, is also incredibly annoying and does the opposite of elicit laughter. There are some relatively impressive visual effects - even though nothing feels tangible and one or two are actually rather disturbing - and there are a couple of action sequences which are relatively well put together. However, the overall experience is just dull, despite all of its in-your-face noise. It's just such a corporate attempt, a movie designed by committee. It also has some incredibly disconcerting fan service, the sort that seems to be replacing actual content more and more these days. Sadly, a lot of people seem to be lapping it up. Of course, if you enjoy this film, then good for you; I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm simply saying I don't. Despite the occasional highlight, it's an uninteresting and uninspired affair overall. 4/10."
810,Free Guy,7," ""They Live"" meets ""The Truman Show"":Shawn Levy's Academy Award-nominated ""Free Guy"" is an homage to/parody of the whole culture surrounding multiplayer online games. The movie has gotten compared to ""The Truman Show"", but I also noticed a connection to John Carpenter's ""They Live"" (the scene where Guy puts on the sunglasses reminded me of it). There's also a sense of the underrated ""Ready Player One"".Unabashedly over-the-top, you're sure to love it."
811,Free Guy,8," Really good movie:This video is ridiculous but in a good way. There isn't a single thing that makes sense and that's why it's perfect. From the countless quotes to the characters' rambling behaviors, everything leads to situations outside the norm and for this very reason it makes you laugh.The protagonist is an NPC who does not know he is and falls in love with a player who does not know that he is an NPC. The problems of understanding between the two start immediately but Guy quickly adapts becoming a crazy splinter for the company that manages the servers. Quite obvious ending with the final battle against a video game villain and love story with a happy ending, but everything is handled in such a way as to always leave you on the verge of bursting out laughing.Among the countless quotes I found references to Inception, The Matrix, The Truman Show, John Carpenter's They Live, Avengers, Star Wars, Fortnite and Pop culture in general. In this movie the creators really enjoyed inserting references to the most diverse movies with remarkable results."
812,Free Guy,6," When the Truman Show Meets the Lego Movie:One of the biggest problems with movies these days are trailers. I say that because, well, it sort of kills some of the massive twists that could make the film much better. For instance, having a twists that Guy happens to be an NPC in a online shootem-up would have been pretty good. Then again, I'm not entirely sure if it would have worked out all that well anyway considering that the plot ended up being pretty predictable, and that we were accused of spoilers when in reality we have just pretty much figured out what was going on.As the trailer points out, Guy happens to be this NPC in an online shootem-up, and he meets this character that he falls in love with. It turns out that the character is actually a PC, and in fact there is more to this character than meets the eye. The thing is that the world is going to be shut down because the company that is running the game wants to upgrade it to a new release, however, as I suggested, something has happened in this version which means they have to fight against having the game shut down.It was suggested that this film was a cross between The Truman Show, and The Lego Movie, with a number of other things thrown in as well. Actually, this whole idea of living within a world oblivious to the fact that people are watching you is very much like the Truman Show, except that since Guy happens to be an NPC, nobody really pays all that much attention to him, that is until he decides to start leveling up.This is the catch, because apparently NPCs aren't supposed to do that, only players, however he manages to get his hands on a pair of glasses that reveals the reality of the world around him. However, as I suggested, he actually isn't supposed to do that, so how is it that an NPC is not only able to kill a PC, but also steal the PC's glasses. Well, that comes out eventually, but the thing is that it is pretty easy to actually work out once you know what is going on.Still, I did rather like this film, even though it wasn't anything that was necessarily original. One thing that it does is that it explores the nature of reality, and also the nature of consciousness (which has probably given a little bit too much away). Then again, this film doesn't dig too much into many of these issues, namely because it is a fairly light hearted film. On the other hand, especially with regards to the nature of reality, there is a lot of Trumanesque in this film.I thought it was fun, and enjoyable, but then again it is Ryan Reynolds, and I don't mind the odd Ryan Reynolds film, though he can be a little dry at times. Mind you, the innocence of Guy, and also the fact that he goes around doing good in a game that is a less raunchy version of GTA, is rather interesting. Of course, watching all of the violence going on behind the scenes while the NPCs simply wander around isn't too bad, which does sort of sets it apart from the other movies that I have mentioned, however, I can't really say that it is all that original.Hey, at least the Lego Movie left the big reveal until right at the end."
813,Free Guy,5," Half of a good movie:Parts of this were okay, with a few good gags and a premise that had potential, but it's overloaded with stupidity, needless youtuber and twitch streamer cameos, and a plot that isn't followed through on. Yeah it's cribbed from better sources, but it's not the worst thing ever despite being largely meh. Needed a bit more thought put into the overall concept but for what it was, it was okay."
814,Free Guy,7," Free Guy:I did play GTA III on the PS2 many years ago. So the free wheeling world of Free Guy had some familiarity.From the initial scenes where it is noticeable mainly due to lack of product placement and branding. Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a bank teller, Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) the bank security guard live in a virtual world.Guy realizes that he is actually an NPC (non player character) in Free City, an online video game. His artificial intelligence kicks in when he meets Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer.)In the real world, Millie (Jodie Comer) is suing software developer Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing the code developed by her and Keys (Joe Keery.)Somewhere in the game is the evidence that Antwan is the software thief.Free Guy is an action comedy that relies on the effortless charm of Reynolds. It riffs movies like Ready Player One, Truman Show even The Matrix.Disney who now owns 20th Century Studios even mine their properties ranging from Marvel to Star Wars which is also reminiscent of Ready Player One.It is a fun movie, although I'm sure Keys could had mentioned to his fellow workers much earlier that Antwan was a heel who had stolen the code."
815,Free Guy,6," Ryan Reynolds and great CGI  but everything else was amateur.:Taika Waititi didn't nail down the villain character well enough, instead of evil ideas he went with ""who cares"", including every dialogue piece. So he breaks the 4th wall from fake acting when ever he speaks. His supporting characters come across patronising for no reason.The other two main good characters are young and haven't developed their own personality - they mostly smile and say all the right things. Sometimes posing in hero shots, sometimes smoothly arguing with volume for no reason. - Totally the opposite of calm collected rebels letting off steam, which is what the Players in the game are about.If you watch it for Reynolds, his character's best friend, and the CGI, it's worth it."
816,Free Guy,4," Annoying:Total disappointment. After so many good reviews, I went to this with high expectations and it didn't deliver at all.90% of the jokes didn't land; Ryan Reynolds is the same as in every other film, nothing special, nothing new; I'm still trying to find out that great actress called Jodie Comer, as - again - I find her really unnatural and forced; Lil Rel Howery looks like a male version of Tiffany Haddish, doing the black role white people like; a very childish approach with a pathetic romance and really lame situations...Well, at least I liked the world created, most of the effects and Taika's role. Unfortunately, I think that's all. Ah, Dude was funny. A bit."
817,Free Guy,6," gamers:An original film to say the least. But maybe a little too dumbed down. Especially the 3rd act was really standard and by the book. But overall its just a feelgood movie, and not that deep.6/10: good but a little standard."
818,Free Guy,8," Its a really fun movie:You don't have to understand game to watch this one, but if you do, this movie can be more fun.It was hilarious all the way till the end, so it make some 'serious' scene feels more sharp at the other hand. Nothing can be seriously wrong about this movie, and that's good."
819,Free Guy,8," Surpassed my expectations:I entered the movie expecting to laugh out loud, and I did. Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi are comedic geniuses. What I didn't expect is the great chemistry between Ryan and Jodie Comer. Their relationship carried the movie.Also, the trailer and the first act made us believe that it's the generic ""we live in a simulation"" movie like many others. But, as we progress, the movie becomes its own thing. And it's fantastic."
820,Free Guy,5," Some brilliant video game moments get lost in a trite story:There's been a long and storied history of bad video game movies, movies that tried to recapture the magic of pixelated form into something that was going to keep fans and newbies alike happy but for one reason or another failed in their mission to turn gaming greatness into a film of quality.In what is a major win for the film, Shawn Levy's Free Guy thankfully does an amazing job of capturing the video game magic that many gamers feel when they log into their game/system of choice and enter into a world that provides endless hours of entertainment and there's no denying that when Free Guy is focused more around its video game origins this is one of the most enjoyable Hollywood films of the season but sadly the film is lumped with a trite plot line that feels like a poor man's Truman Show, one that takes away from all the chaotic fun it had at its disposal.Creating yet another chance for its star Ryan Reynolds to bring out his Deadpool act for a more wider ranging audience, Free Guy see's the content to coast along actor bring NPC (non playable character) Guy to life as his happy go lucky bank teller finds out his idyllic yet repetitive life is in fact nothing but a program for a game he is only just made aware of and is very much a part of, its a familiar set up in a colorful and chaotic world yet while it roars along for the first act, Free Guy sadly becomes a lame and tiresome love/life affirming journey that in many instances is too preachy where it should have been pure sugar coated silliness.There's moments within the film that are exactly what the doctor ordered, Guy waltzing the streets for the first time with the game around him made alive or a hilarious fight with a quickly programed muscle clad opponent (""catchphrase"") are brilliantly staged and inventive but Guy's awkward romance with Jodie Comer's Molotov Girl/Millie is not what the film needed, especially when billed alongside the films insistence on providing life lessons or by somehow making Taika Waititi utterly unfunny and annoying as he gets little too do as the films shoehorned in villain Antwan.Never the most original of directors, you wish a director with more willingness to stray from the usual had perhaps brought Free Guy to life other than Levy, while the action and spectacle is all on point, there's something wrong with what Free Guy wants to be and what it ends up becoming, a mix of brilliant video game to life moments lost in a terrible story with a bunch of characters and happenings that are instantly forgettable.Final Say -A frustrating experience that does a lot right bringing the video game culture to cinema but also a lot poorly when it comes to story and characters, Free Guy has some fantastic components caught up in a generic ride that isn't worth a second thought.2 1/2 boiled turkeys out of 5."
821,Free Guy,4," Alright. But Overrated.:Thought this looked alright, but was in 2 minds as to whether I should go see it or not as it did look some what weird & wacky.The film follows Guy, an NPC (Non Playable Character) living a controlled life in Free City (A Game Universe) in a Video Game under the same name. It is then that Guy starts to break free from the programmed life he's been living & starts to develop his own actions, feelings etc. However, he, the people & the whole city are under threat from permanent deletion as the game's sequel is going to take over & eradicate the original game, Guy must then fight to escape before he's pixels.I found the film, story wise & graphics wise pretty good, not to mention unique & different, well it mean it did after watching suddenly occur to me that it was a modern version of The Truman Show, the concept was the same & similar. There's plenty of action scenes, eye candy & some interesting rom-com stuff going on.However, the treatment of men in this film was bad, not to mention the snide dialogue added in for good measure from Hollywood as with films of this day & age typically do, it was highly unnecessary & uncalled for. Not to mention the stereotypes & cliches regarding gamers & of course, the runtime at 108 minutes & the pacing being too long.Aside from that it was alright, but nothing amazing. I'd say it's pretty overrated for what it is & not exactly a great film.4/10."
822,Free Guy,4, Meh:Heard good things about this movie but in the end it just ended up being very average.Will be forgotten by the end of the year.
823,Free Guy,4," Free Guy:Ryan Reynolds is Guy who doesn't realise he's a background player (NPC) in a violent video game owned by Taika Waititi who in fact stole much of its workings from Jodie Comer and Joe Kerry. Comer's avatar teams up with Guy and real Comer and Kerry unite to bring Waititi down.Big, loud and spectacular - this has some enjoyable set pieces and the 2 leads are engaging and deliver witty performances. It is though an unrestrained mess full of endless impressive effects that ultimately win out in the battle with the story which is pretty slight. Like a cross between Ready Player One and The Truman Show, but not as much fun and accessible as the first nor as touching or real as the latter."
824,Free Guy,10," People Everywhere Just Want To Be Free:Ryan Reynolds is a non-player character in a shooter game, a teller at a bank which is robbed several times a day. His best friend is bank guard Lil Rel Howery and they love Free City, and their lives. Their world is divided into their peers and the godlike ""people with sunglasses"", who are the avatars of players. Then one day Reynolds spots Jodie Comer in sunglasses, and wants to talk with her. When he does, he catches a glimpse of the reality behind his existence and does the unthinkable. He steps outside the narrow paths of his existence and becomes a hero.It's not the first time this theme has come up in movies or even drama. What, after all, is Pirandello's SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, or Hubbard's TYPEWRITER IN THE SKY, but examinations of fate versus free will? Yes, this romantic comedy version of the fantasy wears its symbolic message, that we don't have to accept fate, that we can choose to be heroes and champions of kindness and life, a little too obviously to please me. Even so, its unfailing good humor, kindly disposition and great CGI won me over as a great popcorn movie. With Taika Waititi and a host of current stars in cameos."
825,Avengers: Infinity War,10," Best movie of the MCU  incredible from start to finish.:Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!"
826,Avengers: Infinity War,," Great:This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience."
827,Avengers: Infinity War,10," Best Cliffhanger of all Time:A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars."
828,Avengers: Infinity War,9," EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER:Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.Rating: 9.6."
829,Avengers: Infinity War,10," Better than Endgame:Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie."
830,Avengers: Infinity War,," A film that pulled off the impossible.:Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.10/10"
831,Avengers: Infinity War,10, EPIC:Infinity war seemed much better than endgame to be honest.
832,Avengers: Infinity War,10," How MCU should have always been like:It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time."
833,Avengers: Infinity War,8," A superior avengers sequel:Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned."
834,Avengers: Infinity War,8," It all led to this: superhero film at its best:#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better."
835,Avengers: Infinity War,10," To this day one of the most impossible films to pull off:This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight."
836,Avengers: Infinity War,10, The best:This is is the best marvel/avengers movie every minute is very great no cap.
837,Avengers: Infinity War,10," avengers infinity war:A wonderful movie and the action scenes in the film are some of the most wonderful, especially in the Battle of Titan. I liked the fact that Thanos was capable of defeating all the battles in the film and he did not use a plan and the end was sad, especially the death of Spider-man"
838,Avengers: Infinity War,10," Way better than endgame:This film is way better than endgame!
The actions better
The writings better
The dialogues better
The cgi is better
More shocks and more emotional.
Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.
I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!
But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
839,Avengers: Infinity War,10," Somehow they pulled this off:I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise."
840,Avengers: Infinity War,10," This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave  brilliant and better than it has any right to be.:Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next."
841,Avengers: Infinity War,9," Extravagant clash of the titans:Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
842,Avengers: Infinity War,8," The first Marvel film I really liked:The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films."
843,Avengers: Infinity War,10, Amazing:With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.
844,Avengers: Infinity War,10, It's a great fantasy for sure BUT:It's great film apart from 5 minutes of utter stupidity in writing and directing. Who or how or why does one no see that they make him go to sleep so they have every opportunity to just kill him or chop his arm off or anything they want to stop him. Why would no one think that's a ridiculous thing to put in the movie. Just really gets on my nerves.
845,Avengers: Infinity War,9," It made the top 100 for a reason:Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed nearly all of the protagonists, allowing the villain to win. As he should, no cop-outs, power ups or plot-armors for the main cast. Great pacing, crisp visuals, a great soundtrack, and a haunting ending. Incredible."
846,Avengers: Infinity War,9," Avengers Infinity War: Marvels crown jewel:Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film"
847,Avengers: Infinity War,10," The standard for every crossover movie:Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more."
848,Avengers: Infinity War,9," Marvel's best:I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made."
849,Avengers: Infinity War,10," A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype:Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.
5 stars out of 5"
850,The Matrix,10," Just wow:When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging."
851,The Matrix,10," Benchmark forever.:The Matrix - 1999This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."
852,The Matrix,10," The timeless classic.:This film doesn't age, it will be contemporary even in 2030 or 2040.
Wachowski's best one, by far."
853,The Matrix,10," A watershed moment in film-making – and what a kick-ass masterpiece:** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
854,The Matrix,," One of the best action sci fi action movies of all time!:The film is as well crafted as the matrix itself! On another level entirely to any other science fiction film from the last 20 years . Getting lost in another world, is interly what Cinema is made for. This one takes you into a whole new universe interly ."
855,The Matrix,10," Agent Smith: Human beings are a disease  a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.:The Matrix is a high concept film, that succeeds in its endeavour with awesome cinematography. Deserving of its praise, though not perfect.The concept and the villains are what I love most about it. Everything about the agents excellent, Hugo Weaving gives his best performance. Cypher who's Judas, the true villain of the film, the most sensible. The character development and the choice of casting in regards to Trinity, the only real weakness of the film. I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix. I get that you become hardened in a certain environment, but I don't see that as the case here. So Trinity loves Neo and he has to love her back, okay. Laurence Fishburne's terrific as Morpheus."
856,The Matrix,10," Immensely entertaining  intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!:Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."

859,The Matrix,," a masterpiece:and this is all. because each explanation sounds wrong. sure, the acting,, the plot, the fight/action scenes are great. maybe unique. but the essence, for me, remains the basic idea . a fake reality against the pure truth. and the magic as clothes of each character. because it is more than a film. it is a revolution in the way to see a film and to discover reality. you are Neo. and the mythological mix of symbols and cultural references and the simple story who seems have more and more levels are more than fascinating - it is real. sure, Matrix has a lot of reviews and around it is very easy to say hypothesis, verdicts, opinions or, maybe, critics. it is enough to say it is a masterpiece. or the perfect fascinating fairy tale."
860,The Matrix,9," A sci-fi action thriller milestone:'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
861,The Matrix,10," Ah yes. My first existential crisis.:I have an interesting history and relationship with this film. Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it's first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up ""How do you define 'real'"" Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that 'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.And that's about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid's first viewing, this movie successfully found it's way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it's head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it's writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that's just the power of this film."
862,The Matrix,10," The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever:My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing."" Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later (my God has it already been 16 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. 
10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he."
863,The Matrix,10," Exhilarating 4DX profound experience!:So much greatness about this well done crafty philosophical masterpiece! One of the greatest films ever made; a true benchmark in cinema and huge meticulously brilliant cabinet file of important metaphors. I smile so much while watching The Matrix, I'm so happy it had a 20th anniversary. I'm beyond intrigued by these types of society thought-provoking gems; there aren't enough of them!!"
864,The Matrix,10," 20 years on from release  some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.:20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."
865,The Matrix,9," ...it is not the spoon that bends  it is only yourself.:I remember taking a class in social psychology many years ago. The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics."
866,The Matrix,10," Welcome to the Real World.:Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."
867,The Matrix,9," One of my favorites:At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."
868,The Matrix,," What is the Matrix? Well  one of the best films ever  for one thing...:The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects, folks."
869,The Matrix,10," The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come:The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."
870,The Matrix,10," The world of computers:Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human rebellion.This was excellent beginning to the franchise and probably the only good film out of the trilogy. TThe CGI was awesome, the fight scenes were cool and the acting was.Do watch this."
871,The Matrix,10," Still hip as heck even after 20 years:You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."
872,The Matrix,10," Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!:Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one. Check out my others if you're interested for now 10 out of 10 phenomenal movie in many ways!"
873,The Matrix,9," Wow! I Finally Saw It!:This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action."
874,The Matrix,10," The more you watch it  the better it gets:The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too."
875,Samaritan,6," Just makes me wish that Stallone was in a really good superhero movie:Yeah, he played Judge Dredd and Demolition Man. He was in Guardians of the Galaxy and Rambo is a Bonafede hero, but Samaritan makes me feel like I wanted to see the Italian Stallion (not a bad superhero name at all) as Batman or Captain America, and I know what you're thinking but still, something like that, not necessarily that.I give Stallone credit for being able to be a selfless actor at times. He knows he's old and he does not mind playing the role of an aging action hero, which he did here so perfectly.I don't see it as a blockbuster that should have come out in theatres. The fact that the movie revolves around Samaritan's relationship with a 13-year-old boy felt like he was trying to outdo big Arnold's lackluster, Last Action Hero, and it's even more predictable than a Rocky movie without the deep character dive that makes that worth wild
Still, it triggered the child in me that remembers when Stallone made movies that might as well made him a superhero and the adult that consumed so many superhero movies that I just want to see the man suit up, for real."
876,Samaritan,7," Stallone gets to act his age and still be a credible tough guy.:Didn't have high expectations, but this was a pretty good movie. The story, with Stallone as a retired super hero living anonymously in a dystopian near future, allows him to play his own age while still being a tough guy in a credible way. The idea works well for him and he is perfect for the part. The kid, who the story sort of revolves around, is also good, and I expect to see a lot more of Danish actor Asbaek (from Bergen and Game of Thrones) who is excellent as an almost sympathetic bad guy. Thankfully the director avoids the one thing I find so annoying about these kinds of movies - endless fight scenes."
877,Samaritan,7," I don't get the hate:Is this the best superhero movie ever made, hell no, is it the worst movie ever made, not by a long shot.Stallone plays to his strengths hereno long bits of dialogue for him to chew over, checksome good action scenes, checkvulnerable young kid for him to save, check-some dodgy CGI, check
twist in the end you didn't see coming, unless you are that person at work who sees every twist before they even start watching it, checkactor who makes you say to your family, ""who is that guy?, what else was he in?"" Checklaughter track, when you realise it was the annoying kid from Hannah Montana, and the only way he has grown in 15 years is the addition of multi coloured cornrows, checkreasonably good supporting cast, especially the main bad guy, and then when you realise who it is, and what he was in, makes you hate ""the dans"" for ruining the end of game of thrones, because that's how Euron Greyjoy should have beenJoking aside, it's a good movie and you won't want the 2 hours back as wasted time, I'd be a happy man if Stallone kept churning out films like this till he enters the pearly gates, yes he's old, but would I want to pick a fight with him god no.Well done Stallone sir, as it says in this movie ""I'm a fan"""
878,Samaritan,," Good  entertaining vehicle for Stallone.:Many of the movies I have enjoyed over the recent years are ones where a good guy is able to put the bad guys in their place. Such was ""Taken"" with Neeson, the series ""Reacher"" with Richeson. Here we have Stallone playing a guy who tries to be invisible, but is forced to spring into action when he sees wrong.The back story involves a pair of brothers, twins, one becomes Samaritan, who fights for good, the other becomes his rival, Nemesis. Many years ago in a giant fire it was believed that both of them perished. In Granite City (not the one in Illinois) a young boy keeps his hopes up that somehow Samaritan survived and lives among them.This is a better role for Stallone than most of his post-Rocky roles. It is a good mix of fantasy and reality. We know that some of the ""super"" traits he demonstrates is fictional but fit well in the overall story line. The story is good, the action is appropriate, there is a twist of sorts near the end that requires we re-think everything we saw. But there also is lots of violence and language that pushes the boundaries of the is PG-13 rating. I would not want my under-17 children to watch it.My wife and I watched it on Amazon streaming. We found it to be worthwhile entertainment."
879,Samaritan,8," What is good? what is bad?:Finally watching a film with Stallone as a super hero. The film is about twins, while one is good (Samaritan) and the other is bad (Nemesis), they disappeared 25 years ago and everyone thought the good killed his brother and vanished. However, the boy was bullied by the bad guys, and Stallone the neighbor came out and punished them, and their friendship started. The bad guy came back and wanna kill him, and I found out his superpower (binary fusion!) where his cells can reproduce and thus he is not getting hurt! Through he need to lower his temperature and thus there is much ice-cream in the fridge! While the bad man (Cyprus) wanna simulate Nemesis and destroy the city and boy, Stallone then went and rescue him. During the fighting, everyone knows he is Nemesis instead of Samaritan! What a surprise! Anyway he knocked down the gangster and rescued the boy, and a happy ending....Originally a 6-7 stars movie, however I really like the final idea of the movie...do not easily judge who is good and who is bad, your heart can tell you how to be good..so I give a 8 points to it! Keep going!"
880,Samaritan,7," Enjoyable:Watched this with hubby who wanted to see it (but I didn't) and we both enjoyed it.Plenty of action and Sly, despite the fact that he's approaching 80 looks good and believable. You believe he can still kick some a*. He looks like he still works out and keeps in shape since his First Blood days.With a backdrop of a really poor and crime ridden, gritty city, he (Samaritan) fought Nemises decades ago and is believed to be dead, when a kid fan discovers he's living in plain sight in his own neighborhood.He gets Samaritan to fight the bad guys. But is Samaritan really the good guy?Everything converges into an epic battle with plenty of hand to hand combat, guns, weapons, bombs and the kitchen sink thrown in. You could do worse on a Sunday afternoon!"
881,Samaritan,5," Stallone was good but the movie is a letdown:Really have no clue to the thinking behind movies like this, it's like watching a really bad live action cartoon, the awful clunky editing gives the impression that it was a last minute decision not to make it a mini-series but a TV movie instead.At 76 years old Stallone does as good a job as actors half his age, some of the physical stunts and fight scenes are surprisingly quite good but the entire movie was let down by childish writing and an overall silly story together with painfully amateurish acting from nearly all the supporting cast, the flip flop personality of characters within each scene made it a confusing watch.On the whole it could have been good, had the story not been concocted by the person that wrote the lego ninjago animated series.It honestly reminded me of movies I watched in the late 90s, and no that's not a compliment.I give this a generous 5 stars for Stallone and a few really good stunts, the rest of the cast along with the story gets a big fat 0."
882,Samaritan,7," Enjoyable enough:It's somewhat generic and highly predictable but it was still fun, kids between 10 and 16 are going to love it since it's very much aimed towards a younger audience but as an adult I found it fun enough
Stalone has got the grizzled aged man down to a Tee and it's wild how much in shape he still is.Probably wouldn't give it a second watch."
883,Samaritan,8," Solid enjoyable movie:This was simply a fun movie.It had enough story to move the plot along, enough characterisation that the primary and secondary characters had distinct personalities, which is nice, had enough of a twist to remain engaging but it was telegraphed enough you don't need to overthink it.The plot felt like it had enough space to breathe without becoming slow or dull at any point, so the pacing was excellent.Enough is said in dialogue that the characters felt like they had lived lives and didn't need to cram their life history down our throats like some movies have them tell each other stuff they all know already just for exposition.The movie just showed it through natural dialogue and actions based on the circumstances, except by the kid but his character is a loudmouth who doesn't shut up so it kind of fit without feeling expositiony.Sly Stallone was pretty good. I'd forgotten he can be pretty decent as an actor, as long as the role is in his range, which this is.Frankly the kid was kind of irritating, but the kid actor playing him has played annoying jerk who should get punched both times I've seen him.Hopefully he either grows up to be less annoying, if that's a personal trait translating into his roles, or he picks a role or two where he plays something someone who doesn't need a good slap just to avoid being typecast as ""Oh god not him again"" which he's at risk of becoming of it becomes a trend.Overall it's one I'd have no problem watching again, which is much better than the forgettable, consumable movies we've become used to expecting these days. I'd say it's a solid 8, it's damn enjoyable.It's kind of a shame for the movie makers, the cast and crew etc. Because it's one that seems like it would get good word of mouth and seemed to be aimed at cinema release, and dumping it on prime probably hurts the bonuses and residuals that probably would have applied, as I bet it gets a lot of traction and positive feeling and probably good reviews, just for being a genuinely good movie made to be enjoyed by the audience for a pleasant change."
884,Samaritan,8," Actually Surprised How Good this Was!:I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I have never been a huge Sylvester Stallone fan, but I like the raw, grittiness of this character. Reminded me of his Rocky days. I also find myself liking the movies he's been doing lately. They typically have a message and things get blown up and bad guy smashed to pieces. LOL! So, I guess I'm more of a fan than I thought, which is another surprise. This movie is violent but but enough to where you can not watch with your whole family. It is your typical good vs evil but with a small predictable twist. 'Wanna' did a great job and I enjoyed his acting and role in this movie too."
885,Samaritan,7," I love the idea of Stallone as an aging superhero:IN A NUTSHELL:
A young boy learns that a superhero who was thought to have gone missing after an epic battle twenty years ago may, in fact, still be alive.The movie was directed by Julius Avery, written by Bragi F. Schut, and stars Sylvester Stallone.THINGS I LIKED:
Who doesn't love Sylvester Stallone? I love the idea of him as an aging superhero. He does a great job and looks fantastic. What an epic career he's had.Javon ""Wanna"" Walton stars as the young boy who pulls Samaritan out of ""retirement"". Don't let his innocent face fool you; in real life, he is a fierce, five-time Georgia State Boxing Champion and four-time USA Boxing South East Regional Champion. He's the youngest athlete to represent the brand Under Armour!There is a sweet chemistry between Stallone and Walton.The opening credits look and feel like a comic book, superhero movie. Well done.I got a kick out of reading the boy's list of people he thought might be Samaritan. One of the notes he wrote said, ""Pizza delivery guy - ran really fast."" ha ha
There's a tasty twist that adds surprising depth.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
""Take back what is yours"" by stealing from others? That's what's wrong with society today. People think they're entitled to what others have worked very hard for with no thought of how their actions affect others. Of course, that's the mantra of the bad guys in this movie, but I'm seeing this attitude more and more in everyday life.There are plenty of action sequences, although none of them are very memorable.Some of the CGI isn't very good.It's not entirely clear what Samaritan's or his brother's superpowers are.Does anyone want an origin story?TIPS FOR PARENTS:

886,Samaritan,6," It would be easy if only bad people did bad things...:You know this was so close to being a good movie.It needed more Rambo level violence, basically all the action scenes lacked a punch, I don't think I seen one person get cut. Stallones character was bottling up so much rage so to just resort to mainly pushing people was a bit of a letdown.My main issue was with the bad guy though, I had no idea what his plan was, or why he was motivated to do it.I'd pretty much given up on him as soon as regular people on the street start clapping him and following him into some kind of cult, who wrote that nonsense.Anyway I'll end on the positives, it was a good idea for a movie and Stallone was great as a haunted has been hero."

888,Samaritan,7," ""Yeah. I just pick up garbage for a living. That's what I do."":Intrigued by the trailer, this looked like it could have been a real gritty and compelling story, but I think the film only partially delivered. It takes on a comic book air at the outset with a narrative of a super-hero attempting to save Granite City from a hostile nemesis named..., well, Nemesis. Both presumed dead now for twenty-five years, the city, and particularly one young boy, have reason to believe that the hero called Samaritan somehow survived a fiery death and will come out of the shadows to take on a new villain with a mission to shut down the city's electrical grid and return power to its citizens, which in this case refers to the low-life elements who would run amok and loot the city for all its worth.We've seen Sylvester Stallone as the unassuming hero before (""Rocky"", 1976), as well as the hassled ex-military man on the run and forced to defend himself against an out of control, narrow minded sheriff (""First Blood"", 1982). In this one, something felt off about his character, Joe Smith. It sounded like he was trying to change his voice for the part, and it felt unnatural. The young kid Sam Cleary (Javon 'Wanna' Walton) was okay, but it felt like the script couldn't decide if he was going to turn out a good kid or a bad one. Swayed by his insistence that Joe Smith was once the city's champion Samaritan, Sam forces Joe to take on Granite City's new Nemesis Cyrus (Pilou Asbæk) with three simple words - ""You help people"".The film offers enough clues as to the real identity of Joe Smith, harking back a quarter century ago, but the reveal turns things slightly on its head as we come to grips with a former villain attempting to seek redemption as Granite City's new hero. Combined with some supernatural elements in the story, like the hand forged hammer reminiscent of Marvel's Thor, the story came across as just slightly contrived and derivative. Not to say it was bad and not worth seeing, but I guess what I expected was something more.P. S. Keep an eye on the body language expressed in the scene of Reza's (Moises Arias) thugs running down Joe in their car. Joe's body is splayed in a crucifixion pose, calling to mind a similar scene at the finale of ""Cool Hand Luke""."
889,Samaritan,4," Stallone was the only good part of this film:Like most movies based on a comic book this movie was really awful. It was particularly bad because it took itself too seriously, there was absolutely no humor and I'm saying that as a fan of Stallone. He just couldn't do anything to save this movie.Everything about this film reeked of inferiority. Bad direction, bad cinematography, bad edition, and a terrible script. How did this turkey get made? This film is so emblematic of Hollywood's cultural bankruptcy.Stallone was good, as was the nemesis character. The kid was annoying, the Tom was annoying, the bad guys were baying annoying. There was no entertainment value here.The scenes at the end were so ridiculous, so comic book, so stupid, and so adolescent.There was just absolutely no redeeming value in this film, save your time, watch something worthwhile."
890,Samaritan,6," A hero vanishes and reappears:This movie had a good plot and Sylvester Stallone was good in the movie, I just think they could have used the idea more than what they did. There is a twist I will not spoil but it surprised me.Sylvester Stallone had a satisfactory performance as this hero trying to be a normal person, and the kid played by Javon Walton had a good bond with Stallone's character throughout the movie.When the action scenes happen, they look cool and can be nicely shot. There are some little funny scenes throughout the movie, also I the movie was a bit slow at times, but it did not bother me as much because I was focused on what was happening.The main villain had a backstory connected to Stallone's character, but I wanted a more to it than just that. I will say, the backstory for both characters is interesting and got me behind them.Samaritan (2022) was an entertaining movie I just wanted more to the main idea it focuses on. Some people might like it and others might not, but I liked it for what it was."
891,Samaritan,7," I Enjoyed This Movie Immensely for What It Is:If you are looking for some new take on the superhero genre, this provides somewhat of a nuanced take on it. I won't rehash the plot since most reviewers have already done that.Stallone is still alive and kicking both as an actor and as the character of ""Joe"". He's an over-the-hill super hero trying to just be ignored. The movie attempts to tackle some modern day socio-economic issues such as inner city poverty, rampant crime, defunded police, and overworked single mothers. However, its done so ham-handedly, it doesn't really make its point. The IDEA of this movie was awesome, but the execution feels amateurish and lazy.There are tropes in all action movies where the villain's henchmen either can't shoot straight or keep shooting when it does no good. The latter is the case here. They surround Joe at the climax and just keep shooting at him even though they know he has super powers and that the bullets are having no effect. Joe mows through hundreds of them. That was unintentionally hilarious.Where this movie shines, though, is the premise. A former super hero, worn out from the years of trying to save people who don't seem to want to be saved. His world is gritty, ugly, but he still cares enough to monitor police radios. This was almost an interesting take on the ""afterlife"" of a super hero, but it didn't quite get there.The acting was hit or miss. Stallone was great. Javon Walton as the kid who believes in Joe was okay, but he's written kind of like every other wide-eyed kid in movies. Pilou Asbaek as the villain Cyrus is way too over the top to be taken seriously. His evil plan makes no sense and I have no idea how he expected to pull it off or why. Martin Starr, who is so good and funny in Stranger Things, plays almost the same role in this movie as someone weeding out conspiracy theories, but he is underutilized.While the movie is not great, it doesn't take itself too seriously. I caught on to the ""twist"" ending about halfway through the movie, so it wasn't really disguised very well. I give the movie credit for trying to be original. There are some nice action scenes and you could see the genesis for a great original movie in the hero genre, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Still, I was never bored during the entire running time. Stallone is still kicking it at 76 and I think this is one of his better movies in a long time."
892,Samaritan,3," I continue to beg: rated R please!!!!:Samaritan starts off with a really cool stylized opening scene that got me excited. The first act is mildly entertaining. You can feel the streaming-level quality but it's still enjoyable in one-time viewing kind of way.Then the second act starts to meander and lose steam. I start to notice the bad acting, the inconsistencies in logic, the idiotic character decisions, and some really stupid parts that made me roll my eyes. The third act doubles down on all of this.I went from ""this is pretty decent"" to ""get this movie out of here."" It also didn't help that I found it fully predictable. Maybe I watch too many movies but nothing surprised me.But the thing that annoyed me the most is the decision to make this PG-13. All of the action scenes are screaming for an unrestricted R-rating. I saw a similar thing with Netflix's The Gray Man. It's a much better movie but should have definitely been rated R.The difference is, The Gray Man did a great job of hiding the restrictions on violence, strategically with camera angles and edits. Samaritan doesn't try to hide it at all. There are scenes of brutal violence with zero blood. A throat is slit... with ZERO blood. It makes the movie feel amateur.We keep seeing examples like this, like Morbius, a vampire movie without blood. I don't know when they're going to learn that this is a terrible strategy. PG-13 supposedly sells more tickets, but a good rated R movie is going to be more successful than a bad PG-13 movie.But... this is a streaming movie with, to my knowledge, no theatrical showings. Tickets aren't sold. So why in the world would you limit yourself? Same with The Gray Man (limited theatrical release). I'll never understand it. Stop being cowards and go all out. (1 viewing, 8/28/2022)"
893,Samaritan,7," Pleasant surprise for coming out directly to streaming:It was no block buster, as it lacked a bit in plot, but for what it was aiming for, solid effort all around.Didn't see the little twist at the end coming but wasn't really looking for one. Which was also addressed superbly with his response to the kid.It could've been brightened up a bit, and what the fk was up with the audio???? I was constantly turning it up by 10 to 40 above what I normally need to have my TV on to hear dialog, only to have some tremendously loud scene blast the audio the next second. Then when he gets hit by the car, dialog audio was fine, tv was on 25 ish, only for the car crash to be enough to rattle the pictures on the wall."
894,Samaritan,7," An entertaining (maybe even must-see) watch for fans of non-Marvel / DC super-heroes:In superhero flick ""Samaritan"" pre-teen Javon Walton (living with his single mum Dascha Polanco) thinks reclusive neighbour Sylvester Stallone (in good form) is a rekowned superhero who supposedly died years ago... but who might now be back to save their Gothamesque city from the riotous crime wave being unleashed by bad-guy Pilou Asbaek (good - as a Michael Shannon lookalike) & cronies inc Sophia Tatum, Jarod Odrick & Moises Arias. It slows up before it's action-packed conclusion, but is well made & atmospherically directed by Julius Avery. For those into twists on the super-hero genre (away from DC or Marvel) it's an entertaining (maybe even must-see) watch."
895,Samaritan,7," Decent B Movie Action Flick:I was expecting very low to begin with so this actually surprised me with how not total garbage it was.The good: This movie is actually competently directed and edited. The script isn't good by any means but it actually flows consistently. The B action scenes are few and far between but they are still somewhat fun and entertaining. Sly being Sly gives automatic bonus points, just being in the shot makes it watchable. 75% of kid actors make me cringe and this kid actually didn't, he put forward a concerted effort. The villians are generic but get a bump from the lead who is a notable actor.The Bad: It's a B movie so expect some cheesy dialogue, some moments of not great performances, tacky special effects, flashbacks...oh boy flashbacks. The story is basically a ripoff of several far better films mashed together with a fraction of the budget. Plot holes, moments of absolute stupidity/ why did they do that moments. The mom annoyed the hell out of me.At the end of the day this movie was a masterpiece compared to a film like Morbius, and that came out in theaters people! If your into this kind of generic actioner it's absolutely worth your time if you have a Prime subscription. If you know what you are getting into it's a perfectly forgettable movie to watch if you have nothing to do."
896,Samaritan,8," Age old story still enjoyable one:RATED 8/10
Language: English
Source: Amazon Prime
RECOMMENDEDAge old story and presentation, but still watchable. There is no lagging moment and the action blocks are quite decent. Sylvester as super hero is fun to watch. Even though it is run of the mill, it has some surprisingly good characters, moments and dialogs.Definitely I am recommending because of Sylvester presence and for his body language. The hero twist is good and it adds more value to Sylvester character. While watching some scenes reminds me the Tamil movie ""vikram"" and Kamal acting.Enjoyable action flick to watch in the weekend. Low your expectations (par with OTT release) and you will enjoy this one."
897,Samaritan,8," So refreshing after all Marvel copy/paste prod.:I really enjoyed watching this movie and as I said in the title, It was really refreshing to see something different than crappy marvel productions. Maybe because this hero movie has kind of oldschool 90's movies felling, and it's not just because of Sly
(respect for that man!). I wasn't bored even for a second when watching it. Really recommend to check it out if you are one of this people who stopped watching Marvel's productions some time ago. Simple story, great acting, some really nice shots. Even one fight scene where is no cuts, just one longer shoot which I really like. Of course Samaritan has some minuses like for example some CGI scenes or explanation wherefrom they got explosives of - they could come up with something better! Still great movie, worth over 100 minutes of my life."
898,Samaritan,7," Sly did his best with what he was given.:In the oversaturated arena of superhero films, that last thing you want to see is a bland story riddled with plot and technical issues. Aside from Sly's amazing presence, even he couldn't save the cliched and underwhelming screenplay. Aside from one decent twist, the rest of the story was generic and predictable, and lacked that ""superhero intensity"" in its writing. There wasn't enough substance in the story to merit the 102 min runtime, and the slow pacing didn't help much either. The directing wasn't any better with the long dragged out scenes, and the constant 360-degree spins everyone did when they got punched. I mean what's up with that nonsense anyway, was the action choreographer a gymnast? It's an ok one-time watch, especially if you're a Sly fan."
899,Samaritan,10," I was really impressed!:That sounds very ostentatious and pretentious but I wasn't expecting much irrigardless of my hitherto misgivings I went for it! Cause I will always go for a Stallone film! Why not! I really wish he would do a lil' intimate indie before he decides to throw in the thespian towl but this one was really really special, I believe so, the end really brought everything together! I was so happy for him , I hope to see more ingenious scripts and more fun ideas and well crafted script come to life, I really enjoyed it and I hope to see more of Stallone and hopefully he takes a pen and does something himself , maybe just sitting there with a few friends and plays cards and they can talk about stuff maybe ad-lib I don't know but its all good! This was really cool!"
900,The Suicide Squad,9," It Gets Better and Better.:The first time I watched The Suicide Squad it was with a number of other people and I have to admit that I really didn't get much from it. It was just OKAY to me.A couple of months later, my husband and I watched it and I really listened and paid attention, and I thought it was excellent - apart from the dumb / gratuitous harm to the birds (what the heck was that about, anyway?) and the ridiculous villainous ""thing"" (I won't say more in order to avoid a Spoiler tag). The 'twist' early on, and the comedic flow, especially between Elba and Cena, was fantastic.The thing is, although I normally do not find many movies to be rewatchable, we just got through watching it (for me, a third time) with family, and if anything, I found it even funnier than the last time! My rating of 9, is for the times I laughed just today."
901,The Suicide Squad,8," Wanted to hate it...:...but this has all the imperfections and grit I want in an ADULT superhero movie. As odd as this seems, I saw ""Invincible"" animation series, and this reminded me of an IRL version of that.The comedy is actually funny and not cheesy or cringy, the superheroes outside of Cena don't all look roided to be powerful, and there's actually good acting.Marvel is for kids, DC is for adults-hate it but if you're honest you'd agree."
902,The Suicide Squad,8," The Dumbest Squad Just Made the Greatest DCEU Film EVAHHH!!!:Remember when James Gunn was 'temporarily' fired by Marvel Studios and we were all disappointed by the decision? Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made."
903,The Suicide Squad,8," The ""REAL academy award winning"" Suicide Squad:I remember as if it was yesterday my utter disappointment in 2016 when I purchased my tickets to watch Suicide Squad back then. No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I'm VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I'm also glad the studio acknowledged that. I'm VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn't feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry's this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that's where this movie shines. It's VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*
Well written characters / performances
Comedy/Action (is not repetitive)
Effects/CGI
Story / plot / script*Cons*
Thinly written Villain
Climax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more ""teamwork"" and not one character being the reason they won (you'll see what I mean)
Some Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn't need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are ""impossible to do"" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn't, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an ""The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad"" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut."
904,The Suicide Squad,8," THIS IS HOW A SUICIDE SQUAD FILM SHOULD BE:Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008's Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are hiding with the characters, stories, and films, and how to do right, and that's why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruing this beautiful universe that's filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC chose James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you're not familiar with, he directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder's) that when having the right person/people behind a film, he/she will kill it. And THIS IS HOW ""The SUICIDE SQUAD"" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that's all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn't care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It's not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of ""blood"" coming out of the bodies, it was ""flowers"" which made the 3 or 5 min scene very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that's happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don't like Cena's acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how hood his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you'd know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can't tell what it is.My rating is 8/10
WATCHED: in an IMAX Theatre."
905,The Suicide Squad,8," Happy surprise!:This movie is surprisingly fantastic. Much has been said about it so I want to just add my two cents about universe building in movies. From the very first scene, Suicide Squad made it clear what it was. You understand the world you are in and the rules in place, or lack there of. It then follows those defined rules throughout. Comic book movies can take many forms from gritty realism like Joker all the way to off the wall zany like we see here. As long as the movie follows it's own rules, viewers are willing to go wherever the director wants. What an absolute blast of a good time this one is."
906,The Suicide Squad,8," Fun From Start To Finish:I have to admit I don't like the first Suicide Squad. And Birds of Prey is a bit boring. So when Harley Quinn come back for the third time I don't have high expectations. No offense to Margot Robbie, her performance is great but the story from both movie is just not that good.And enter James Gunn, this man totally change the game. This movie is way better than two other DC movies that I mentioned above. It is fun, full of action, and surprisingly gory. Something that I didn't expect before.The story still follow the same pattern. Convicted criminals with special powers were given the task to save the day. This time there are more characters introduced than before. I personally like the character King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. The chemistry between fatherly figure Bloodsport (Idris Elba) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) is so good here.I like the comedy here, so chaotic. The CGI is believable, the action is cool, and as I said before, it's gory. So many blood splattered, body dismembered, throat cut, they're not for those with weak stomach for sure. I just wish there's more explanation in the end of the movie. But other than that, it's a good movie."
907,The Suicide Squad,3," The movie didn't do anything for me...:As ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021 release; 140 min.) opens, Savant is released from prison and joins the rest of the Suicide Squad to go on a dangerous mission on a island called Corto Maltese. Soon enough, things go wrong, very wrong. But then we learn that another Suicide Squad team is getting onto the island. What the heck is going on here? We then go to ""3 days earlier"" as Bloodsport is cleaning the prison's floor. At this point we are 10 min. Into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the long-delayed follow-up to the original Suicide Squad film in 2016. Don't call it a sequel, though, as much (but not all) of the original cast isn't returning. It's more like a reboot, as if regretting how not very good (ok, worse than that) the 2016 film ultimately turned out. A reboot already? Yup, already. This one is written and directed by James ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Gunn. One thing is clear: once the decision was made that the 2021 reboot was going to get an R rating, Gunn decided to make it as hard an R rating as possible. None of that matters of course, as long as the story line works well and the characters are fully developed. Alas, that is where this movie falls way short. There is no character development whatsoever, as if it is assumed that the viewer already knows these characters (some viewers may some of these characters, but surely not all viewers and not all characters). As for the actual story line, it's hard to say anything about it without spoiling so I won't. For me (and I realize this is a subjective view), it all made for scatterbrained viewing, and in the end this movie didn't do anything for me, sorry.""The Suicide Squad"" opened wide in theaters this weekend but also was available for streaming on HBO Max, where I caught it. The initial box office reports are not very kind, and make this the lowest opening weekend gross ever in the DCEU. Of course, things are not helped by the rapidly surging and highly infectious Delta coronavirus variant (why, oh why, do TENS OF MILLIONS refuse to get vaccinated is beyond me). If you are a fan of the DCEU or the 2016 Suicide Squad or simply a Margot Robbie fan, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
908,The Suicide Squad,3," The first one was much better than this.:The Suicide Squad (2021) is a movie we saw last week in theatres. The storyline follows a ""suicide mission"" on an island that needs to be executed and those who would execute the mission faces impossible odds. They need to infiltrate a base and destroy it. The base houses aliens set on world domination and has thousands of troops protecting it. Based on the odds and those selected for the mission, what could go wrong? This movie is directed by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and stars Margot Robbie (Wolf of Wall Street), Idris Elba (The Losers), Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), John Cena (12 Rounds), Viola Davis (The Help) and Pete Davidson (The King of Staten Island). The storyline for this is very straightforward and the action scenes are appropriately over the top. The dialogue is funny and pretty clever and the film starts off very good. I really enjoyed the introduction of the characters as they are rolled out and the mission begins...and then the movie entirely falls apart. The focus on one character at a time as they executed their action scenes was terrible. It just become blatantly bad. I'm not sure if it was an artistic attempt or DC Universe sabotage by Gunn. The initial villain was very good and the movie should have probably stopped there; unfortunately, they decided one more super villain was needed, and it was an abomination. Overall there were aspects of this film that were entertaining and this film had some potential, but trying to be too stylish and creative sunk the ship of this having any hope of being good. The first one was much better than this. I would score this a 3/10."
909,The Suicide Squad,1," Criminally Terrible:The first SS was a real idiocy, but this new part has managed to topple the sheer level of lunacy and imbecile crass low ebb by all means/
The recipe is simple - awful plot, unlikable characters, loud noise, lots of gore, cringe deaths, horrid pace, total absence of depth or integrity, sheer profanity and and on top of all that - lackluster performance where every aspect is overplayed and overcooked in lukewarm watr.Even Margot Robbie did not save this abomination since her part is a pathetic clowning with no merit.In a word - stupid to the brink of clear abomination."
910,The Suicide Squad,2," TSFW = Too Stupid for Words:Before you think ""Yea. We know. It's stupid. That's the point"" please keep in mind that there is stupid and there is STUPID. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is stupid but it's wonderful. This film is simply STUPID."
911,The Suicide Squad,1," Everything that you say it's great  it felt 100% off and didn't work for me:And that's basically it. There is not a huge deal with this movie, because is an idiotic movie with nothing to offer other than laughs and gore. As a fan of the ""Saw"" saga, you aren't amusing me with fantasy violence where bodies explode and we rarely see any real suffering. It's graphic, but it's not really that violent (except for Harley for like... 10 seconds).Then the jokes. I didn't laugh once. There is nothing to do here. I'm guessing the actors just didn't land the jokes for my taste, because I laughed alot with Pratt and Bautista and Cooper in the Guardians movies.And then the ""weirdness"". I just didn't care for it. Enjoy it you all, I guess? I'm not sure the director admitting it's going to make a dumb movie saves it from having to actually deliver a coherent story, a well paced story (instead of wandering in an Island) and good characters and/or villains. This movie has none of that... because it doesn't want to (it's pretty obvious)... which is pretty insane. But who cares because... Stallone is a Shark?"
912,The Suicide Squad,1," Redefines what pure garbage is:Unfortunately this is no guardians of galaxy. The story is totally empty and idiotic where it bitterly fails trying to humor the audience by bringing the dumbest elements in movies ever possible, it's doubtful if a 5th grade child would find this funny. The first suicide squad was silly but watchable, birds of prey is terrible, but this sequel is so much worse, it redefines what pure garbage is. The suicide squad is just incredibly gross and stupid beyond imagination, with awful acting and directing I couldn't find a thing that's even worth commending. What's actually funny about this movie is the ridiculous amount of paid or moronic reviewers and critics overrating this trash at a 7-10."
913,The Suicide Squad,3," Meh:I like James Gunn movies. But I think you really need to be a comic book fan to really appreciate this film. I watched it twice and I could not get into the ridiculous characters like King Shark, Rat Girl and Pok-A-Dot Man. The comedy wasn't there for me. Perhaps I am just too old for this film. But it seems to be doing well here on IMDb so I guess I am missing out on something."

915,The Suicide Squad,3," Suicide Squad actually committed suicide:I don't know where to start, this movie is just trash . The first movie was fun to watch and this is awful. Maybe I'm probably giving it 3 because of Hurly. I loved her crazy, bold character *-*"
916,The Suicide Squad,5," Gunn without Structure:I think it's pretty obvious that James Gunn doesn't agree with me about ensemble movies, not that he thinks they're easy, but that we differ on how good ones are constructed. I feel that ensemble movies are hard because you have to create a variety of different characters all swirling around one thing, and that their journeys need to interrelate on some level beyond the mechanics of plot to help reinforce the central point of the film. Gunn sees ensemble pieces differently. He seems to see them as large canvases for him to fill in with whatever his imagination deems amusing at the time with little regard to structure. There's definitely entertainment to be had with Gunn's approach, but I ultimately find it a frustrating kind of entertainment that's fun in spurts but ultimately feels like its constantly stopping and going instead of being handled by an artist who understands exactly where the narrative train needs to end up.Gunn's haphazard approach to structure often works against him, but I feel like his opening to The Suicide Squad actually works fairly well. We are introduced to Task Force X, a team of half a dozen criminals with super abilities sent to the small Caribbean nation of Corto Maltese. Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), they land on the beach in the middle of the night and immediately get wiped out by the local army leaving only Flag and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) alive. This is told through the eyes of Michael Rooker's Savant, brought into the mission and our very quick introductory eyes into the rules of the world, including the pressure that Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) brings to convincing these prisoners to go on her missions for her, and ultimately how she deals with people who refuse her orders (heads go boom). All of this mission, though, was a mere distraction for the actual force with the actual mission, though, and the way the film jumps from the distraction to the real team and then back in time three days to see how the real team was formed is an amusing misdirect that I feel like is a fun way to begin the film, especially when you consider the gore that Gunn loves to wallow in, being able to put it all on full display with this R-rated DC comic book movie.The real team is led by Idris Elba's Bloodsport, an assassin who can't miss, followed by John Cena's Peacemaker, David Dastmalchian's Polka-Dot Man, Daniela Melchior's Ratcatcher 2 (her father was the original), and Sylvester Stallone as the walking shark Nanaue. These five have the mission of finding Jotunheim, a secret installation, home to Project Starfish, and destroy it after the country of Corto Maltese has fallen to a military coup. This cast of colorful characters gets moments throughout the film to highlight their unique personalities, and there's interest to be had here. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be Polka-Dot Man, subjected to alien experiments by his mother that gave him an extra-terrestrial virus that manifests in the form of circular, primary-colored discs that he must expel in one way or another twice a day. The problem is that his back story comes at the most random time where all progress in the story unnaturally comes to a stop for him to tell his tale.And that's the sort of thing that happens to all of them except the characters that we already know, Flag and Quinn. In between, there are definitely amusing bits like the competition between Bloodsport and Peacemaker as they walk into an enemy camp, brutally murdering enemy combatants along the way to the central tent, trying to one-up the other with Bloodsport realizing, in comedic fashion, that Peacemaker had the better time of it than him. But, instead of moving on with the story, the effort to capture the scientist in charge of Project Starfish to get them inside, we have to catch up with Quinn who has been captured by the military and brought to the president because he had fallen in love with her. Again, this isn't necessarily bad stuff, but it's the story grinding to a halt completely to tell what essentially amounts to a nearly unrelated short film.I will say this, I think this is the first time that Harley Quinn feels right. I don't have a lot of history with her, having only watched The Animated Series a bit as a kid and never reading her in the comics, but moreso than in the original Suicide Squad and definitely more than in Birds of Prey, Quinn feels like an interesting character as she kills the president because she got a bad feeling about him, and she made a promise to herself to do the right thing the next time she got a bad feeling about a man she was involved with by murdering him. When she breaks out of captivity on her own, it's the absolute best use of her from an action sequence standpoint so far. Gunn knows to give her lots of guns and plenty of environmental tools to make her sequence where she kills several dozen soldiers feel believable, and the effect of taking it somewhat subjective by having flowers explode everywhere as the sequence crescendos is actually quite nice to see. My problem is that this sequence feels like it could have been pretty much cut completely and we wouldn't have missed anything particularly important to the actual story at hand.The actual story, if you were going to dig through the morass of different threads, seems to be about American efforts to push off its dirty work onto third-world countries, and it doesn't really manifest until something like 90 minutes into the 130-minute-long movie. America hired Corto Maltese to study a space starfish that expelled smaller version of itself that attached to the faces of people and starts controlling them, turning them into extensions of itself. The rest of the film is this huge battle to take it out, using everyone's special abilities to attack Starro in a weird version of the ending of The Avengers (I would be surprised if Gunn wasn't consciously mirroring the MCU team up movie), and it's nice to look at.That being said, though, it ends up feeling like a purely technical exercise because it's just the latest in a series of events. It doesn't feel like the culmination of a story. The whole 90 minutes that preceded it was a random collection of moments of people, connected only by the barest of mechanical plot strings. There's nothing thematic undergirding the earlier moments that brings them together with the larger plot in the form of the giant Starfish that attacks the city, so I end up looking at this finale as mere spectacle and nothing else. It's pretty in the Gunn twisted kind of way, but I end up feeling like it's really empty.I know this film is getting pretty universal praise, and I sort of get it. It's thinly entertaining, but it doesn't really gel overall. It's the best the DCEU has been since Shazam!, though."
917,The Suicide Squad,2," I think you're confused by the cast:If it wasn't for this star studded cast, people would see the truth. There's literally no plot here. The worst of this somewhat trilogy, comes in last due to the boring portrayal of the thinker and some dumb giant starfish as a big bad. Lame, incoherent and silly. I actually liked the first one but Will Smith was a believable alt-hero. Idries tries, Cena can't act (we know this and don't care), actually not enough Harley and everything else was pointless. Not as good as anything CW does for DC, and that's saying something."
918,The Suicide Squad,1, What a way to kill a franchise:If Suicide squad means to kill a franchise then this is aptly named. A giant starfish from out of space? The villain of this movie is a starfish with an eyeball? Give me a moment to sigh and roll my eyes. Doesn't DC have any good writers or stories? When I saw Peter Capaldi I thought I was watching a two hour episode of Dr. Who... This is so confusing because I don't know if this is a reboot or a remake. All the senseless killing and deaths try to come out as funny but it's just sad and pathetic. This movie is even worse than the first movie... Maybe the third reboot will be the one because people are going to want to forget this.
919,The Suicide Squad,1," An insult - forced  parodied Deadpool  but much worse:I could not watch more than 17 min - its a bad parody with ridiculous antiheroes, even worse humour and killed off characters from the first seconds. Very graphic and vulgar and not in a bearable way."
920,The Suicide Squad,1, people like this crap?:This is what people like? This is what gets 8 out of 10? This is an awful movie. Suicide Squad is so mush better. That got 7 out of 10. Well this is what I gave it. But I give this 1 out of 10. This has a bad story line.
921,The Suicide Squad,2, absolute rubbish:From the opening scene onwards the film is incoherent and a waste of time.
922,The Suicide Squad,2," Complete garbage:I expected this to be bad, but the final film exceeded my fears. James Gunn struck gold with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and the attempt to repeat that formula is apparent here - only it's amped up to the nth degree. The plot, if one can call it that, is one long exercise in subverting expectations. But Gunn is no M. Night Shymalan and no Monty Python either. This is pure randomness and lack of structure masquerading as subversiveness and edginess. I found myself reminded of the old Ren & Stimpy cartoon show at times, the bad later seasons, not the good early ones. Trying so hard to be edgy that it just becomes cringe worthy.This film reeks of studio desperation. It's Homer's makeup shotgun from the Simpsons in movie form. A bizarre, unfocused and pitiful smear of concepts, moods and sounds.Speaking of sound, the use of music in this film is awful. Different genres of songs are used randomly like in a late 90s Tarantino rip off. Most of the pop songs don't even work with what's happening on screen. Harley's escape is such a case. Frequently the score is interrupted full stop by sound fx or jokes. Again another attempt at ""subverting expectations"" and a simple trick at that. People expect music to go on, so when it's suddenly interrupted, they feel surprised. It's a dumb man's clever movie.It's not entirely without merit. Some of the photography is nice. Some of the acting performances are good (Polka Dot man, Idris Elba, the Shark and Rat Girl stand out) and some are awful (the villains, the nerds in front of the computer screens who do nothing but comment on things). Some of the character interactions are funny. Most are not.The first 20 minutes are amusing. The movie grinds to a painful halt in the middle and never regains its momentum. It's one exceedingly long, constantly interrupted, unfocused stew. Worst of all is the blatant disrespect this film has for its audience.I compare Marvel movies to fast food. Simple, safe, unhealthy junk food for the brain with very few nutrients. This is worse. This is vomit cooked up with artificial flavoring and sold as haute cuisine to people without taste buds.Bad as the original Suicide Squad was, this made me nostalgic for it."
923,The Suicide Squad,1," One of the worst ever seen:IMDB have started to censur long good thought-out reviews so this will be a short one to replace the actual review.This movie is horrible. It is one of the worst I have ever seen and it make movies like Black Widow look like a masterpiece. The directing, acting, script, and editing all suck.Do not see this filth."
924,The Suicide Squad,8," The Complete Package:The smartest move DC ever made was to quit concerning themselves with cinematic world building and focus on making (mostly) standalone films that were simply entertaining...and didn't require a master's degree in Snydernomics to appreciate.Their second smartest move was nabbing James Gunn for The Suicide Squad, and not just because the first film was terrible. Material like this needs Gunn's flair for irreverence, clever dialogue and, most importantly, instilling characters with engaging personalities. He may not have created Suicide Squad, but this adaptation has his stamp all over it.And for the first time since his directorial debut, Slither, Gunn is unbound by the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, something else the material really needed. Hence, the film is vivid, violent and vulgar, yet at the same time, seldom feels pandering or gratuitous. Punctuated by gobs of gags and hilarious dialogue, the movie earns its dismemberments and f-bombs along the way. In fact, the whole thing plays very much like Guardians of the Galaxy without a filter.And like Guardians, it's ultimately the characters that matter. Ironically, the one we're most familiar with - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) - is the least interesting, perhaps because she's already been established with two previous films and there isn't much more Gunn could do with her. But everyone else is wonderfully realized and played perfectly by the ensemble cast. As Bloodsport, the de-facto leader of this new team, Idris Elba strikes the right balance of stoicism and uncertainty, while John Cena (as Peacemaker) once-again demonstrates he's more adept at comedy than pure action. Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmaichian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) are also fun, each with amusing backstories. But King Shark steals every scene he's in, a perpetually hungry manfish who manages to be both monstrous and endearing (and a role Sylvester Stallone was born to play).With the exception of Task Force X director Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the antagonists are perfunctory. Their plan, however, is gloriously insane; the dictator of Corto Maltese plans to wipe out America using a 30-year-old experiment gone wrong: Starro, a giant extraterrestrial starfish that spawns face-hugging offspring to re-animate & control the dead. This leads to a final act that's as hilarious as it is grotesque, aided by amusing visual effects.Unlike the first film - which was mostly just bells & whistles - The Suicide Squad is the complete package, delivering an abundance of action, humor, violence and well-realized characters. James Gunn's playful approach is just what was needed, making it the best - and maybe the smartest - DC film since Christopher Nolan hung up his spurs."
925,Next Exit,5," Breaks the first commandment of film making...:... which is never make a promise to the audience that you can't deliver on. The first 3 minutes of this film sets up a premise so outrageously compelling that it would not surprise me if another film-maker grabs it and makes a proper movie about it down the road. However, and this is the point, Mali Elfman, the first-time Director of Next Exit, does nothing with it. Just sort of leaves it hanging, a constant reminder for the audience of what this movie could have been. That said, this is a not-bad road movie, and a so-so rom-com, but any attempt to call this science fiction is stretching it. The kind of film where, if you were flying NY to London, you might get hooked somewhere over the Atlantic. Maybe. And, oh yeah. Elfman has this really weird talent for repeatedly miscasting former model Karen Gillan (of Dr Who fame). Elfman produced THE PARTY IS JUST BEGINNING, 2018, where Gillan was so off-character it seemed as though she was deliberately trying to implode her own career. In this film, she is barely recognizable. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
926,Next Exit,1," Next Exit Isn't Worth It.:Next Exit Isn't Worth It. And I saw it for free. They were giving away tickets for one performance, and the theater was maybe 1/3 full.What good can I say about it? Interesting cinematographic approach in the first scene.It is very choppy, with no clear point, message, or plot. It is various unconnected scenes joined together with no real flow between them. The heroine sells a television set, pockets the cash, and then destroys the television in front of the buyer with no clue of why. They are driving on I-40 westbound and suddenly are on a dirt road with no indication of how they got there."
927,Next Exit,9," Haunting of Next Life (without a Manor):No pun intended - yes the two main actors played key roles in a Mike Flannigan show. Actually the male lead was also quite impactful in Midnight Mass - and will be in the next show of Flannigan too. So no surprise he got thanked in the credits.Maybe because the two seem very comfortable with each other. And when I say that, I don't mean they hit it off as characters, but their chemistry is really something to behold. A road movie can get boring or stall at some point. I never felt that there was a chance of that happening here.And that is a testament to the movie, script, director but also the actors of course. There are episodes on the road and there is the goal they want to reach. The goal that includes Karen Gillian - another collaborator from Flannigans past (Oculus, highly recommended), though you may know her from the MCU as Nebula.But again the main focus is the duo and their journey. The dialog feels fresh and real - the characters while flawed and on a self destructive trip do connect with the viewer. Really well made and while it may not really answer questions about after life (or maybe it does for you?), it is more than worth a watch."
928,Next Exit,5," Misleading:While it may be a mediocre existential drama it has almost nothing to do with sci-fi or mystery.They say the journey is more important than the destination, yet in this case the journey was slow burning and boring just as the destination.I was hoping this movie would be more in the realm of McDowell's ""The Discovery"". But it was not. This theme has already been exploited in many movies and TV shows so why they chose the sci-fi platform to tell a simple story that contained no exceptional emotional charge or identification with the protagonists is beyond me.This is not a bad fim (drama), but also not a good one. For some reason I expected far more."
929,Next Exit,7," Enjoyable Humanistic Drama  Not Sci-Fi:I really liked this film. It's mis marketed and they didn't need to drum up some crazy sci fi angle at all. The acting and character development was enough for me.I notice a lot of movies like ""Smile"" deal with trauma based subject matter and the deep parts of the mind that are affected by it. But they have to hook you with gimmicks instead. They didn't need that here.The acting is really good, the ghost aspect is confusing but I think that should have been the premise not the sci-go angle. Either way it's a good film. I really was into it at the end and I've personally dealt with similar problems so it impacts me more.Either way go into it not with sci-fi lens, but instead a humanist drama. Enjoy! 7/10."
930,Next Exit,2, Next Exit is the definition of Saggy Middle Syndrome:Next Exit is the most boring movie that starts out very promising.In the intro we have a scene of a boy who interacts with a ghost at the foot of his bed by video camera. We are TOLD this is the cause of millions of suicides because everyone believed what they saw. They believed it through their intuition! Wooo! I don't care.Anyway it starts out with these characters who are all feeling and no thought. This girl smashes a TV she was about to sell a man and escapes for no reason.She realizes her friend is possessed with this suicidal ghost curse and go on a long unstimulating road trip through the midwest. Then it occurred to me what this movie was. IT'S A ROAD TRIP FILM! AHHHHH!!! This couldn't get worse.But at least in most Road Trip films there is a stake following the protagonists. Even National Lampoons had a stake. Even Dumb and Dumber had a stake. This movie has none except for the two characters emo feelings.The movie is rather visually boring to. I was promised a sci-fi movie but that implies it being Star Trek or what not which this is no.Overall don't watch this movie. If you like it we can't be friends. Sorry.
931,Deadpool,," Dirty  funny  sexy  violent and unabashedly romantic: Deadpool has arrived!:I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
932,Deadpool,10," CAN I SEE YOU BETWEEN THE HOLIDAYS?:The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood"
933,Deadpool,8," This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks:Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted."
934,Deadpool,8," Absolutely hilarious but not for everyone:""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it."
935,Deadpool,9," ""Bad Deadpool - Good Deadpool Film!"":If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!"
936,Deadpool,8," One of my favourite comedy's:I really enjoyed this movie and I didn't expect to, I don't really enjoy a lot of 'superhero'
movies so I didn't have high hopes , but this movie was amazing. It was funny, violent and action packed. A really good thing about this movie is that it was different to a lot of comedy's , which easily could've made this movie a disappointment. But it was a great movie and is one of the best comedy's I have watched. If you haven't watched this yet you should definitely give it a try.8.3/10."
937,Deadpool,7," I am NOT the target audience for this one...please keep this in mind as you read.:I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV."
938,Deadpool,9," Love it!:Deadpool is such a great part of the X-Men franchise, & a hilarious one!"
939,Deadpool,9," Not MCU  but still great:Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ..."
940,Deadpool,8," ""Please don't make the super suit green...or animated!"":One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all."
941,Deadpool,9," Crude and violent but also a lot of fun:This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'."
942,Deadpool,10," Hell yeah!:In a world.. where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty, #Deadpool comes along and shows you how it's done! It's the perfect combo of action, comedy, and R-rating that really don't give two sh*ts about your sensitivity. Do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl you've been crushing on during chemistry class in high school? Well, you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for DEADPOOL.Ryan Reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin plays his hot-ass girlfriend, Vanessa. This woman is the embodiment of sexy. They are a match made in Marvel Comics' heaven. But their dream is crushed upon discovering that Wilson has cancer all over, a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers. The lab is run by Francis/Ajax (Ed Skrein) who himself is a bit of a mutant. The brutal experiments turn Wade Wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one. He's now bent on revenge, especially after Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. Meanwhile Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead from the X-Men, try their best to convince Deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys. But let's face it, that ain't DEADPOOL's style! The first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers/creators Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other. The next people in line to thank are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who remind us why we loved ""Zombieland"" back in 2009, they inject the same brand of humor into DEADPOOL and keep the character faithful to the comic books, yes, by that I mean none of that crap version of Wade Wilson in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" anymore! Applause goes to Tim Miller as well, what a helluva feature directorial debut, clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out, if you just let him run with it, it's like giving G.I. Joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart, great things can happen.For those of you who are not familiar with DEADPOOL, just a heads up, this movie, just like the comics, is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex, violence and humor, and that's exactly how we like it. Wade Wilson is a chatterbox, he talks a lot, to some this can get annoying, while to the rest, it's music to our ears, mainly because of the sh*t he says. And he breaks fourth wall, meaning he'll talk to you the audience. But what's even more epic than that is the fact that he is AWARE of the universe that he's in and the universe that you're in, and those two collide in the most epic way possible, so Ryan Reynolds' character, Wade Wilson, makes fun of Ryan Reynolds the actor and also mocks Ryan Reynolds' previous poor decisions like Green Lantern and People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive This movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans, it even has what I think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema. For a while, I heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants, but I'm glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment a.k.a origin story, so it's simple enough for the new fans to follow. I love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic, it's like insult comedy or one of them roast shows, everybody is fair game. The fights are rock 'em sock 'em and the VFX is impressive! And I can't be happier for Ryan Reynolds, I'm sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since ""Green Lantern"" and whatever the hell that was in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" so with this DEADPOOL movie, he finally got it right, you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre, and so now he's really part of the gang. He was born for this role. He was destined to play this. In many ways, Deadpool is kinda like Van Wilder on crack. And actress Morena Baccarin as Vanessa well, let's just say that after watching this movie, every guy on earth will wonder, 'Why can't my girlfriend be more like that!' If you're looking for a date movie, DEADPOOL is it. if you're looking for an action-packed movie, DEADPOOL is definitely most certainly it."
943,Deadpool,8," Meta breaking 4th wall  juvenile humor and CGI action  with Iron Putin to save the day:What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right."
944,Deadpool,8," a much needed breath of fresh air in a stale genre:At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made"
945,Deadpool,," Infinite Jest:""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing."
946,Deadpool,10," ""Let's count 'em down!"":This movie is absolutely brilliant! It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic! I'd say this would be after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises as one of my all time favourite action/comic book movies. It's possibly the most quotable film of the century, the best comedy of the century, literally everything about this movie is awesometacular."
947,Deadpool,," Infectiously funny:This film tells the story of a man who is diagnosed with cancer, who undergoes transformation by a mysterious man to become a man with invincible powers. The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe.""Deadpool"" is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!"
948,Deadpool,8," Funny  entertaining and refreshing:I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon."
949,Deadpool,1," Like Being Trapped With the World's Most Obnoxious Child:You know, the 12 year old who thinks cursing makes him sound ""adult."" The wannabe class clown who always cracks bad jokes and laughs at them extra loud because no one else is.That's all this film is. Unfunny, irritating, obnoxiousness that thinks being obnoxious makes you ""edgy.""After wasting a couple hours on this, you'll do anything to wipe the memory from your mind. Watch old movies, you know, where they still had good writing. Listen to progressive rock or obscure opera. Anything that will get your brain cells back."
950,Deadpool,2," Just non stop jokes that mainly fall flat (NO Spoilers):First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean"
951,Deadpool,3," ""I may be super but I'm no hero."":The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool."
952,Deadpool,10," ""Shh - my common sense is tingling"":Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10"
953,Deadpool,1," Would have been better if they didn't do a hard R film:I'm seriously considering ranking this movie a 1 out of 10, just because how of pornographic it seemed. Honestly, the movie is very fun and could have been a great time for everyone if the producers of the film didn't decide to cater to the manchild virgins out there. Without all the raunchy crap, I would rank the movie around an 8 or 9. A few people did walk out with their children during the film for understandable reasons and that is what pisses me off the most. The people who made this movie know Deadpool inside and out so it stands to reason that they should know what demographic reads Deadpool comics. Just thinking about it pisses me off. F*&k it. I'm giving this film a one out of ten. The filmmakers should know better. There was literally no reason why they had to put out a ""hard R"" film. They could have even made the movie PG-13 if they wanted. I don't mind a graphic movie but I do mind a graphic movie targeted at children. If the sequel does the same thing, I'm not going to spend a penny on it."
954,Deadpool,9," A new landmark for superhero and comedy films:With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence, as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole."
955,Deadpool,1," Everything Wrong with Hollywood in One  Smug  Vulgar  Annoying Package:Hollywood has a ton of problems these days. An irrational reliance on big, loud, CGI filled blockbusters, a fixation with TV style digital cinematography, and a compulsion to make movies that are meme-friendly, self-congratulatory, and above all, trendy. This describes the downright depressing point Hollywood has fallen to in the past decade or so. It also describes, to a tee, Deadpool. This subversive superhero movie is a personification of everything today's sardonic millennial moviegoers cherish. It's vulgar, violent, ugly, devious, ironic, and hip. It's one, big meme. Comic book nerds and teenage boys love it. Fine. I hated every second.The problem right away is that Deadpool is a terrible character. He's a joke, but one that is only funny to those who drool over spandex-clad musclemen and collect kids' toys in their free time. I'm talking about nerds. Deadpool is what nerds think ""cool"" is. Played with infuriatingly self-satisfied panache by nerd God Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is an impeccably sculpted, overtly confident, wise-cracking nerd himself. He can win any self-respecting geek over with a quick reference and hardy, fourth wall breaking high five for those who get it. For those in the know, Deadpool is a naughty wish fulfillment character. The asshole they always wished they could be. To the rest of us, he's just an asshole.Deadpool is among the most unpleasant movies I have ever sat through. I could go a step further and say it is the most unpleasant two hours it could possibly be. Deadpool serves as a shining example of every single thing I hate about movies today. For starters, it's another superhero movie. For all director Tim Miller's insistence that this is a different kind of superhero story, it's really just a typical origin story, peppered with enough F-bombs and sex jokes to make something superficially unique. Secondly, the movie looks dreadful. Digital and grey, just like literally every other movie that has been released since 2010. Is it the current TV-Mania sweeping through the younger generation that is convincing filmmakers to replicate the cheap, washed out look of low budget television? Why else are movies getting worse and worse to look at? Third, and most egregiously, Deadpool is relentlessly full of itself. The script really isn't a script so much as it is a list of jokes, gags, and winks meant only to placate the fans who practically bullied the movie into existence. Deadpool knows its audience will go gaga for its star and his dumb schtick. In fact, they are so confident of their dominion over geekdom that the whole thing reeks of the kind of self-satisfied arrogance of a hack comedian making a dumb crowd go wild.Deadpool is a movie that will make you lose faith in movies. Hell, it made me lose faith in humanity. If this is the kind of thing people will praise as the new gospel, then we as a race are in serious trouble. Deadpool is a bland superhero movie, a vulgar comedy, and a cynical corporate exercise rolled into a rotten chimichanga of the worst impulses of modern Hollywood. It's not technically the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is, in its relentless nastiness, one of the most thoroughly depressing. I got no enjoyment from Deadpool, and it made me question whether I will ever like a movie again.07/100"
956,Iron Man,9," A Marvel superhero film done with class:When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
957,Iron Man,8," Still one of the best MCU-movies:In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: 
Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try."
958,Iron Man,9," Don't waste your life  Stark:With a B-list superhero, a risky lead actor, a genre that hasn't really done much other than say Nolan's Batman, this movie had a lot to prove. Wow, did it ever. It proved that superhero movies can be realistic, emotional, funny and have highly entertaining action. This is the movie to launch the MCU, and started the shared universe that DC comics and other franchises are following.Let's start with the number one reason why this movie is so good: Robert Downey Jr. I am so glad that Jon Favreau kept pressing the studio to make sure RDJ had this role because he completely nails it. He effortlessly portrays the cool, sarcastic, alcoholic, playboy that I don't even think he's acting. He's clearly not perfect as he is the guy we think is awesome but don't necessarily want to be. This role is basically synonymous with RDJ now because you can't think of Tony Stark without immediately thinking of RDJ. Iron Man wasn't a househeld name before but thanks to RDJ's performance, it is now.The action in this movie is incredible as you get to see him fly around, take on terrorist cells and fight the main villain. What I even found to more intriguing is Stark's entire time building his suit, both in the Afghan cave and in his garage because it is amazing to see his genius at work, while still being snarky and basically a tool.The writing and humor is also very good in this movie. I read that a lot of the lines, especially RDJ's were improv, which is able to keep this movie very fresh, not Rotten Tomatoes style, but it helps a lot by breaking the molds of superhero movies.A couple complaints in this film is the pacing and the final villain. The pacing starts off very well, not really rushing into him being Iron Man, establishing his character very well before his abilities. Then the final battle comes around and it's basically just an evil version of his character, which sort of works with the problem of his technology getting into wrong hands, but the fact that it's just fighting a mirror is kind of boring. The final battle comes around pretty quick and it resolved fairly quick as if they are trying to wrap it up really quickly. I did like Bridges' Obadiah Stane with his intimidating yet charming persona but in the end he was just a reverse of Iron Man, not that interesting.+ Robert Downey Jr + Fresh, new start for superhero movies + Writing and pacing (mostly) + Action and Humor - Final Villain Final Score: 9.3/10"
959,Iron Man,8," This is where it all began. Queue AC/DC.:MCU 2021 MarathonMCU #1:Iron Man was my favorite Marvel hero. As a teen I collected 1-150 with the main series. I doodled the Iron Man helmet during class at high school when bored.So it was a huge surprise when this came out in 2008 and it was so freaking GOOD! Jon Favreau, the guy that had done Elf and Zathura (the Zumanji sequel) had just started a cinematic revolution? What!?!? (And Favreau is doing it again with The Mandalorian).Robert Downey Jr. was made for the part of Tony Stark. The origin story was modernized and handled well. They included most of the early Iron Man suits from the comics. They took the time showing the more modern invention of the suit and the challenges of making it work (e.g. maneuvering with the repulsors).I finally understood what Spiderman's fans felt like when Sam Raimi's Spiderman series became a massive pop culture sensation years earlier. Fantastic!There are issues. Pacing mostly. Jeff Bridges is too much the stereotypical villain with an over-the-top fight scene at the end.This was the beginning of the MCU world building effort which was more ""slight-of-hand"" in the earlier movies -- Stark's OCD making itself evident, that Shield guy at the party, and Samuel Jackson pinging Stark about Avengers in the end credits.It began and ended with Iron Man. That makes me happy.""I am Iron Man"""
960,Iron Man,," Best movie of a hero's origin.:Great movie, which serves as a perfect introduction to Tony Stark's character. The antagonist was a bit boring, but except for that, I loved the movie!"
961,Iron Man,8," RDJ is Iron Man:Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie."
962,Iron Man,9," Considering I am not much of a fan of superhero movies  this one is a success:I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film."
963,Iron Man,8," Don't waste itIron Man:There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years."
964,Iron Man,8," Heavy boots of lead  fills his victims full of dread  running as fast as they can  Iron man lives again!:Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008! 8/10"
965,Iron Man,10," A Nutshell Review: Iron Man:With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!"
966,Iron Man,9," Not bad at all:Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.It's well worth its ticket price."
967,Iron Man,," Move Over Superheroes  Iron Man Is Here:Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'."
968,Iron Man,8," Definitely the hero type.:Held captive in an Afghan cave, Tony Stark develops and builds a suit, a suit that will change his life forever.Well overall, I thoroughly enjoyed that, it took me a little time, as I found the first half an hour or so pretty slow, but once it gets going, I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.I have always been a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. And once again he comes up trumps, I appreciated the journey the character went on, he truly does transform as the film develops. Jeff Bridges was great, I thought Paltrow developed well as the film went on.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting and the visuals. Of course I liked the touches of humour that Robert Downey Jr. Added.Unlike some of the newer Marvel films I've seen, there seemed to be more focus on the plot and the characters, it wasn't just a special effects parade.8/10."
969,Iron Man,10," Delivers Intelligence & Great Acting with its Fun:Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film."
970,Iron Man,10," Wow  very impressive !!!!:WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!"
971,Iron Man,8," It's the big Robert Downey Jr show - and I like it!:From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! But of course his bubble bursts when Stark is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to reproduce his killing missile, the Jericho. The sacrifice of a fellow scientist makes him humble and after his spectacular escape Stark decides to better his life. No more manufacturing of weapons for Stark Industries. From now on Stark wants to help his fellow men. Although this decision impresses some (like Stark's secretary Paltrow) it also infuriates others (like Stark's partner Jeff Bridges). This all leads to a action-packed finale in which Iron Man must face a deadly enemy...Iron Man is the big Robert Downey Jr. show. Downey not only brings humor and flamboyance to his role, he also manages to make you believe that an egocentric person can indeed change into a real humanitarian. The scene in which he realizes that someone is willing to make a sacrifice in order for him to escape is even a moving one. Well done. Downey is really a great actor with great charisma.But there is a lot more to Iron Man. There are four or five big action scenes. The first four are so great (the escape from the cave and a sequence involving an Afghan village) that the last one - the big finale - disappoints a little bit. But that's okay. There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Jeff Bridges is always great to look at, although his role could have been played by several other actors. Maybe his storyline is the weakest of the film. His betrayal is no surprise, but his early involvement in this is hard to believe. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Hopefully it will do very well at the box office, because I can't wait to see Iron Man 2. Enjoy!PS: no Samuel Jackson in this version either!8,5 out of 10"
972,Iron Man,," Hits a High Standard of Excellence... GREAT Film.:All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Mark my words, Iron Man is such a movie. I've been privileged enough to view an advanced screening and, honestly, it's the best big budget movie that I've seen in many years. It hits a high standard of excellence for mass audiences by combining humor, a smart plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. The special effects and CGI are probably the best I've ever seen in terms of relatable effects. They're not over the top and don't overwhelm your senses. What's even more remarkable is this movie will surprise a lot of people with its depth while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Iron Man delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Street Kings anyone?) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Downey himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Downey has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed his performance.Minor SPOILER....My only real complaint is the rumor of a Sam Jackson cameo was not fulfilled. He is even listed here as playing the character of Nick Fury. He did not appear in the cut that I saw. After browsing, it's been offered that his cameo was probably just removed for the early screenings. I hope that's true and they put it back for the final cut. This means I'll just HAVE to see this movie again. LUCKY ME!"
973,Iron Man,10," Great Movie!:Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10."
974,Iron Man,," Very Good:Iron Man (2008) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is forced to build an armored suit in order to escape from a group of terrorists but after reaching safety he decides to use technology to help people. I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made, wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey, Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work, although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film."
975,Iron Man,10," MarvelousOne of the BestStark's Snark  Wonderful Action  a Winner:Marvel Studios Never Looked Back after this Tremendous Artistic and Commercial Success. It's Probably No Surprise that the Comic Book Company Knew just what to do with Their Own Creations. Although, Nothing in the Movie Universe is a Certain Thing, the Studio certainly Worked Wonders with this, one of Their Second String Characters.The Casting is Brilliant with Robert Downey Jr's. Perfect Embodiment of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and the Rest Contributing to the Fun. The Director, Jon Favreau, was a Risk. Hardly Known for Big-Budget Action Movies, He Captures the Spirit of the Comics and turned in an absolutely Brilliant Film from Top to Bottom.Fans of the Silver-Age Comics will No Doubt be Impressed. When Iron Man First Appeared in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were in the Embryonic Stages of Reinventing Comics and the Marvel Super Hero Line was being Tested and no one At the Time (except maybe the Fans) had a Clue what They were Witnessing. In the Origin of Iron Man and for a while, the Character was this Hulky, Bulky, Tank-Like Hero, in a Clunky Iron Suit. Not the Sleek Hot Rod Red Iron Man to Come Later. In the Film, this Likeness can be Seen in the Opening where Tony Stark Creates the Character ""in a cave with a box of scraps"". This is a Spot-On Recreation from the Comics Origin Issues and it is a Great Insider's Inspiration and a Fine Tribute to the Movie's Paper Origins.This is just one of the Charms about Iron Man, The Movie. The Thing is Full of Wonder and Wit. A Great Comic Book Movie. One of the Best. Nuff Said.Note...Thanks Jack Kirby wherever you are. Thanks so much for your Art and your ability to bring so much joy to the world. You are the best and truly ""The King of Comics""."
976,Iron Man,8," ""Give me a scotch. I'm starving."":Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made."
977,Iron Man,9," more than an action movie:this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10"
978,Iron Man,," Iron Man Burns Bright In Red & Gold!:Marking the commencement of Marvel Cinematic Universe, catapulting Robert Downey Jr. into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars & also announcing the arrival of Marvel Studios into motion picture filmmaking for it is their first fully-financed project, Iron Man not only succeeds as a quality blend of style & substance but is also amongst the best origin stories cinema has come up with for a comic book superhero.Iron Man tells the story of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark who, while on his tour to war-torn Afghanistan for the demonstration of his new weaponry to United States military, is ambushed & taken hostage by a terrorist group. Working with another captive, he designs an exoskeleton to get out from there & after returning to US further refines his design. The plot covers the change his captivity brings in his entire personality.Stylishly directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man aims for the same grounded approach Nolan applied in Batman Begins & succeeds amazingly well for the most part. The screenplay is brimming with energy, wit & charm, and is brilliantly written & narrated. Production design provides it a very modern feel, Camera-work is vibrantly carried out, Editing briskly paces the whole story which also benefits from Ramin Djawadi's fitting score as well as clever use of existing songs.Coming to the acting department, Iron Man features a star-studded cast in Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard but the film belongs to Downey Jr. who blazes brightly in red n gold with a performance that's absolutely fantastic, effortlessly charismatic & downright polished. Overshadowing the input of the rest & fitting the suit perfectly, this is one role that couldn't have gone to a better actor & how this gifted talent renders Tony Stark on screen is a further proof of that.On an overall scale, Iron Man has enough power in it to please both fans of the comics as well as newcomers. Sure its third act isn't as impressive as the first two but the positives eclipse the negatives by a huge margin. Balancing its storytelling aspects with big budget extravaganza to triumph as a work of quality in the eyes of viewers n critics alike, Iron Man is a highly refreshing, wildly entertaining & largely satisfying crowd-pleaser that's hugely responsible for the foundation on which Marvel Studios stands today. Highly recommended."
979,Iron Man,7," A well re-mastered legend:Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark  with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes  is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up  to explain how he becomes Iron Man  is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland  this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track  or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!"
980,Iron Man,7," Entertaining and Totally Overrated in IMDb:The playboy wolf and genius Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghnistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony's data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon.""Iron Man"" is an entertaining adventure, with great special effects and good and funny story, and nothing else. However, the User Rating of Top 250: #192 is absolutely overrated and offensive to the great movies of the cinema history. The IMDb formula may indicate the movies with massive votes and high rating but never the greatest movies of the cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Homem de Ferro"" (""Iron Man"")"
981,The Fifth Element,," Multi Pass.:Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich star in this wonderful sci-fi tale. Chock full of killer performances and excellent effects.Korben Dallas is your average ordinary New York taxi driver. Fresh out of the military, unlucky in love and this close to losing his job. One day the ultimate fare literally falls into his lap as Leeloo enters his life via the roof of his cab. Leeloo it seems was genetically manipulated to be the ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty and butt-kicking hide a more fragile nature that Dallas and a host of others will have to step up and help her save humanity.This amazing sci-fi adventure from Luc (Leon) Besson has a little something for everyone. Beauty (the gorgeous Jovovich with orange hair even), action and gun-play, excellent acting, amazing visual effects, romance, creative sets and costume design, dynamic and interesting music and a mildly annoying but funny Chris Tucker. You name itthis film has it in spades. 5th Element is hands down one of the best science fiction films ever.I've seen it many times and always want more. I highly recommended it."
982,The Fifth Element,," ""That's ma favorite!"" (Gary Oldman):THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a complex film....if you WANT it to be! It offers varying levels of analysis depending on the tools you have to dig with! On the surface, a ""leave your brain in the cloakroom"" sci-fi yarn, you may well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.Set on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him - nothing's changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind, fire and water together with a fifth ""element"" of unknown origin.Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done a deal with ""The Dark Side"" and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman (from which the one-line ""summary quote"" above is taken) is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it's amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity, femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.The comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of ""will love save the day?"" as if it wasn't always going to???So, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that's what you'll get back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn't fail to have a good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you'd be wasting your time anyway, it wasn't MADE for you!"
983,The Fifth Element,8," A Movie With All the Necessary ELEMENTS!:From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA& ORLANDO, FLThe Fifth Element is in a category all its own. Just take a careful look at the IMDb info for the film. Country: France, Director: Luc Besson, Filming Locations: Pinewood Studios, UK (Mostly), an International Cast, and most certainly, a rather International feel to many aspects of the production. As an avid, lifelong film buff, it seems that as the years pass, the more I watch ELEMENT, the more I really come to appreciate practically every exquisite detail!Oddly, after my first viewing, I wasn't really all that impressed. I suppose it wasn't at all apparent to me just how much of an ""onion"" ELEMENT really was. From the onset, labeled 1914, exquisite design, costume and set elements are obvious! Analyze the external appearance of the alien ""protectors""Quite artistic, indeed. The same can be said of their spacecraft. The music, by Eric Serra, has won awards and quite deservedly, I would say. It adds delicious depth and an International flavor and texture to most of its scenes.There is really something for everyone in ELEMENT. If you want straightforward action/comedy/entertainment, that really doesn't require much in the way of analysis, there is plenty. If you're a bit of a romantic, you, too, should be satisfied. And if you are looking for a ""Message"" or some sort of philosophical moral, if you look, I'm sure you will encounter quite a bit. IMDb lists it as Action/Adventure/Sci-FiTo which I would certainly add Comedy, among other elements.Not that ELEMENT is perfectIt does have a few minor flaws. Gary Oldman, for example, is frequently over-the-top, (but then again, when ISN'T he?) But, I must say, these moments add to the overall entertainment, all-in-good-fun, quality of the movie! Pretty much everything in ELEMENT honestly ""Works"" Which, in the total scheme of things, is what really matters, isn't it?8*......ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"
984,The Fifth Element,9," Korben  my man.:One of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, wrapped up in one of the most subtle love stories ever. The characters are well cast and well acted. The creature costumes and effects are amazing for their time. The story is unique and dynamic. A true classic."
985,The Fifth Element,8," Negative  I am a meat popsicleThe Fifth Element:After making heavy movies like La Femme Nikita and Leon, it is somewhat of a departure for Luc Besson to do this comic, pulp, sci-fi film The Fifth Element. Looking at his work now, with such high-octane humor as the Transporter series, among others, (written by Besson, but not directed), it doesn't seem that out of place. He just must have decided to only direct his more serious fare and leave the fun stuff to others. However, The Fifth Element is by no means a slight film without a fan base. As far as sci-fi goes, this is a very capable installment. With its mythology, creatures, action, and special effects, the movie has everything going for it. The humor that's infused just makes it better, vaulting it through genres and making it accessible to almost everyone who gives it a try.Like most of its ilk, the story revolves around an evil force about to devour Earth and the rest of life itself as it increases in size and power with each influx of destruction and hate thrown at it. Every opportunity to blow it up only makes it stronger. Through a series of fortunate/ unfortunate happenings, (depending on who you are aligning with), we have the paths crossing of a priest who holds the answers for survival, an ex-military, cab driver bent on having some fun and excitement, a strange woman from another place at the center of it all, an evil mercenary out for money, and the government of the galaxy trying to save face in front of inevitable extermination. It is good versus evil traveling through space in order to either shed light or death out to the universe as victory.In what is a nice little introduction to the myth of the fifth element that will unite with the more common four to wipe out evil, we learn of those who keep the secret of its location. We don't quite know if these aliens are good or not until later, but we do find out the impetus for their coming to the temple on display. A cut forward in time introduces us to the president of the galaxies, (played in what would seem to be horrible casting, but ends up being pretty good with Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr.), and our head priest in the guarding of the truth, Ian Holm. Holm explains what the dark force coming after them is and goes on the quest to find the fifth element and her four stones needed to combat it. This supreme being, played wonderfully by Milla Jovovich with a childlike glee and discovery, falls into the unwitting hands of cabbie Korben DallasBruce Willis at his sarcastic bad-ass best. Willis must join with Holm and Jovovich on a mission to recover the stones and find a way to save the world.A lot of the success lies with the man behind it all, Luc Besson. His script is made up of a pretty solid plot line as far as the world destruction goes. Everything makes sense and is explained in a way to not bore us, but instead in tidbits culled from the numerous characters running about it this singularly unique landscape. The art direction is spectacular and for being a decade old, still has some nice special effects that stand up. I've always been a proponent for prosthetics, when able, at the expense of computer graphics. Reactions are always better from actors who have something real to play off of and the lighting and environments just become more realistic. Even so, when computers are used, the effects are more subtle than flashy and never take away from the story that is being told. No matter what spectacle is on display, the script is what is important.All the personalities on display also lead to much of the greatness that The Fifth Element has to offer. Bruce Willis is the king of this kind of role. His quips and rapport with those around him are priceless. Other standouts are Chris Tucker, in an early role for him, and the great Gary Oldman. Tucker takes loud and obnoxious to a whole new level, but it works flawlessly. His radio DJ has no shame when it comes to working a crowd or chasing the ladies, but his utter fear of danger is hilarious. As for Oldman, I have to believe Besson just said create something fresh. This villain is a pastiche of so many crazy components. His futuristic hair, complete with plastic half shield, is plain weird; the southern accent and buck teeth look is just the right amount of hillbilly; and the disposition of greed and ambivalence is perfect for a bad guy. When he explains how destruction allows all the little machines that man created to finally have work cleaning up the mess, it's fantastic. The real beauty, though, is that no matter how many strong lead roles are here, the little guys steal scenes as well. Singer Tricky is great as Oldman's ""Right Arm"" and Mathieu Kassovitz partakes in one of the best scenes in the film when he attempts to mug Willis at his apartment.Even with all its camp and fun, Besson keeps it all grounded in drama as any fantasy tale does. He has a real vision for aesthetics and has changed his scope often as he goes from film to film. From the mobster/corrupt cop world of New York, to the countryside of war with Joan of Arc, he never pigeonholes himself in a style. I am still holding out hope that his newest, Angel-A, with all its black and white, stylish noir feel, will hit the big screens here in Buffalo. It will be a real shame if the rumors are true and the completion of his children tale, Arthur and the Minimoys, will be the final work by him as a director."
986,The Fifth Element,8," Entertainment:There is so much entertainment in this movie it would be almost stupid to write about its flaws. Especially the story is not the best thing here, but who cares. I liked every scene, every moment in this movie. The movie opens in Egypt, 1914, and we meet some strange creatures. From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious sci-fi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest they will return in 300 years, when evil arrives.300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed and turns out to be Lee Loo (Milla Jovovich). She is the fifth element, the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities, and in an astonishing shot we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up in the flying cab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He saves her from the police, she asks for priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), he brings her there.We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones, the four other elements, to save the world. The stones are on a vacation resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker). He has some funny scenes as well. We have also met Zorg, who is played by Gary Oldman in a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was planned by him. He wants the stones as well, he is offered a lot of money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to like. Beautiful settings, great visual effects, Gary Oldman, the beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker and Ian Holm. May be this movie is not for everyone but if you don't think to much you will definitely like it."
987,The Fifth Element,10," A mainstream-cult classic?:I remember when 'The Fifth Element' first came out in the cinema in 1997. I saw it twice. It was awesome. It was only really after its release did the narrative begin breaking through (the ways thing did prior to the internet!) that it wasn't 'very good.' And yet everyone I spoke to loved it. I worked in a video rental store in 1998. It was still a major title and the public seemed to love it, too.Over time I realised that, despite critics seemingly delighting in pulling it apart, the general public thought it was great. They say there are only about ten different story types and that every film is just a variation on the way each is told. With that in mind, 'The Fifth Element' isn't anything particularly original in terms of the actual story - in the distant future, a giant planet of 'pure evil' is hurtling towards the Earth preparing to wipe all us humans out. The only thing that can destroy it is a being of pure goodness (Milla Jovovich before she hit the big time in the 'Resident Evil' franchise), who just so happens to be in the care of a wise-cracking New York taxi driver (Bruce Willis when he still put effort into his performances). However, what makes the film stand out is the way its presented.If ever a film 'built a world' it was here. The special effects may look just ever-so-slightly dated today, they were amazing for the time and I think most people will still enjoy them for what they are. You'll see New York in the future with mile high skyscrapers and flying queues of cars gridlocked around their peaks (beating the 'Star Wars' prequels by a few years!). You'll see a variety of futuristic settings and technology, presented as if they are just everyday items that everyone uses. I hear fashion designer Jean Paul Gauteur (spelling!) personally designed every costume - right from the stars' own wardrobe to the background characters to give every person that 'space-age feel.'I've already said that Bruce Willis was still an A-list star when he made this. His once natural charm and endearing smirk, mixed with wise-cracks and macho heroics worked well here with Milla Jovovich's faux naive persona which underlies her true mystical powers. But they're just the icing on the cake. 'The Fifth Element' is practically an ensemble cast with villainous Gary Oldman as the bad-guy and Ian Holm as the well-meaning priest who's on hand to help out. Maybe the reason there was a certain amount of hate directed towards the film was down to Chris Rock. If you ever see some online list of 'Most Annoying Characters in Films' you'll probably find him as 'Number 2' (only pipped by Jar Jar Binks from 'Star Wars'). Yes, he's pretty obnoxious - but he's supposed to be! You're supposed to be irritated by his antics and he only comes into the story in the last third, so - personally - if you really can't stand him that much, I'm sure he should ruin the whole film for you.Basically, 'The Fifth Element' has everything an enduring film should have. It has action, romance, sci-fi (if you're into that!), adventure, sets, special effects, costumes, humour, brilliant direction (the way characters in one scene answer a seemingly unrelated question a different character had just posed is very nice and adds to the quirky feel very well) and - perhaps most importantly - if has all that without needing to be 'adult' in content. It was rated 'PG' here in the UK and I think it's a film that all the family can enjoy together. Better still... it never received a sequel or remake (to date, 2020!), therefore leaving this as a perfectly self-contained little gem of sci-fi brilliance."
988,The Fifth Element,9," Simply put  this movie is FUN!!!:I really believe that they billed this movie wrong.  Many folks came in expecting the next Star Wars and were disappointed, to say the least.  It's not like Star Wars.  It's kinda like a live action comic book.  Visually stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek. Plot?  Well forget the plot, it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica, intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great stuff!"
989,The Fifth Element,10," earth meet Jovovich  Jovovich meet earth:Talk about love at first sight.This is one of those movies where if you were lucky enough to see it first-run, you did not really appreciate it at the time.It holds up very well. And gets better with subsequent viewings (As does MS. Jovovich who went on to do a string of very memorable sci fi flicks, and one drama where, believe it or not, she played an aspiring wedding singer) Massive (truly massive) talent in front of and behind the camera. Luc Besson in front (crazy as a loon but boy can he write scripts) and Willis/Oldman in front.For the day, the special effects were top notch.There a joyful innocence about the film which was rare at the time, and even rarer today.See it once. See it often. It'll make you smile"
990,The Fifth Element,9," Hugely imaginative and enjoyable:This sci-fi fantasy had a lot of ingredients to be great, a wonderful concept, Luc Besson who directed the brilliant Leon:The Professional and Gary Oldman who is one of the best underrated actors working today being just a few.The Fifth Element is a hugely imaginative and enjoyable film, with only Chris Tucker's annoying character and performance and the occasional lack of flow in the plot being its sole drawbacks. I adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.The script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had.Besson's direction is excellent, Eric Serra's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun. As is the acting, Bruce Willis is charismatic, Milla Jovovich is beautiful and Gary Oldman is the personification of haute-couture corruption. In conclusion, a great sci-fi fantasy. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
991,The Fifth Element,8," Luc Besson creates fun sci-fi:It's 300 years after the previous visit, a Mondoshawan spaceship is bringing the Fifth Element back to Earth to defeat a coming great evil. However it is destroyed by the evil Mangalores on the behest of the greedy Zorg (Gary Oldman). A team of scientists use the DNA found at the crash site to recreate the Fifth Element, a perfect warrior called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). She escapes from the laboratory and drops in on taxi driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He helps her find Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) to bring the five elements together to defeat the evil.This is a great looking sci-fi movie from director Luc Besson. It proves that big sci-fi production is not just an American domain. Luc Besson brings an entirely different sense and visual look to the genre. It is artistic and wonderful. The fashion from Jean-Paul Gaultier really sets this apart. Bruce Willis does his John McClane persona once again. Milla Jovovich makes the best entrance, and Chris Tucker is wacky funny. It is visual candy coated fun."
992,The Fifth Element,10," ""Multipass"":Still amazing after 25 years! By far Luc Besson best feature in my opinion. The story holds up, the acting and even the effects look pretty good by todays standards. Amazingly, the jokes are still funny and nothing about this has aged poorly. A classic action, funny one liners and great fun all round!"
993,The Fifth Element,10," Excellent Fantasy Movie:This is a great movie. It isn't your typical same alien vs. human movie where there is blood everywhere, and the humans win right before they've thought it was the end. It is much more interesting. The story has love vs. evil in a whole new way, and there's a lesson to be learned through it.Honestly, I didn't really care about the plot all that much. The imagination and creativity is awesome! I love the colors and the ideas they came up with, especially how the design of the city. The futuristic clothing is cool too. The only thing I was disappointed in was the enemy aliens. They looked a little too artificial.My favorite thing about the whole movie was the music. It went from techno to opera to jazz, and to all over. I loved the music, partially because they used Engima and Vangelis. Many people are like, ""what the heck was that?"" when they hear the music, but it fits the movie perfectly and leaves you with a feeling more than a theme. I like the randomness of the music, it works well with the quirkiness of the movie."
994,The Fifth Element,9," I finally get it:I saw the fifth element at home for the first time on Netflix, many years after it had come out. I enjoyed it a lot. Didn't love it, but had a great time. Bought if for my wife since she loves the movie. We enjoyed it again.Recently, the movie was playing at one of our favorite theaters for it's anniversary. I was blown away.This movie is such a great adventure, a visual feast, and just alot of fun. I love all the characters and the action holds up. They don't really make movies like this anymore. It's a weird one and I love that about it. On the big screen I really felt like I finally experienced this movie the way it was meant to be seen.This movie rocks, check it out!"
995,The Fifth Element,," Plot wise it is weak and rather silly but  for all its weak points it is great fun with a good sense of energy and wonderful design:Three hundred years ago, the powerful weapon of the fifth element was removed from Earth. Three hundred years later and pure evil has stirred in the far reaches of space  and is heading straight for Earth, with traditional weapons unable to stop it. When the Fifth Element is returned, the ship is attacked and seemingly lost  but scientists are able to recreate the fifth element and are surprised to find it is a beautiful young woman, Leeloo. When Leeloo escapes custody she is helped by ex-army taxi driver Korben Dallas. Korben takes her to the priest she names, but he finds that everyone wants her for one reason or another  then he finds that both the army and the priest need him to go on a mission to reclaim the missing four stones and save the Earth from evil.I have seen this film several times and will usually come back to it if I find myself in the mood  but yet I also find myself thinking of its flaws whenever anyone asks me about it. I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points; generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences, but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with, but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that, like much of the film, it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used  the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from Jean-Paul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film, which manages to be a fun and exciting sci-fi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same, great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it (after all  he is Bruce Willis!) but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker, sadly, fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film (god knows where it WOULD fit!) and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout  not all his fault, his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans, Brion James, Tricky, Luke Perry and Kim Chan. Generally the cast seem to be right on the same page as their director and compliment the material and tone perfectly.Overall this is far from a perfect film and some may find the humour to be at odds with the sci-fi action; but for my money the fact that most of the film backed up this tongue in cheek tone made it all work. Some of the plot has too many ideas or unnecessary elements but most of it is really good and, combined with mostly good performances and stunning designs and effects make for a film that I will watch many times even if I cannot help but see the weaknesses that many others cannot get past."
996,The Fifth Element,," Another Fine Luc Besson Film.:The Fifth Element is another fine example of the filmmaking talents of Luc Besson. Luc Besson, a creative genius and the director of classic films such as The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon (The Professional) has returned to the genre that started his filmmaking career, sci-fi. In The Fifth Element Luc Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he thought of while still at school, Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the film, he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put forward by Milla Jovovich, Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman, who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy, action and romance can be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards, Luc Besson won the Cesar for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply, an excellent film, 10/10."
997,The Fifth Element,8," One of those rare films you can watch over and over:Think V For Vendetta or Shawshank Redemption.It has violence, action, science fiction, imagination, war, great music, total thin leggy eye candy and the acting is impressive!"
998,The Fifth Element,8," Very fun  but not meant to be taken seriously:At first, I didn't know what to make of THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Much of it was corny; some of it was just stupid. But when I stopped taking the movie so serious, I really started to enjoy it. I thought it was a very fun movie.THE FIFTH ELEMENT is about an evil force coming to destroy the world. Five elements are needed to destroy the evil force and save the Earth. Four of them are stones and one of them is a beautiful woman named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), who is absolutely ""perfect"". A priest named Cornelius (Ian Holm) seeks the elements to try to save the world while the military sends a the retired Major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the elements and stop a bunch of alien bounty hunter-like bad guys and a very evil man (and of course very rich) man who is under the employment of the evil force named Zorg (Gary Oldman).And of course, there is the insane but loved radio DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) who gets trapped in the middle of this whole thing and becomes the comic relief of the movie, even though this movie really does not need comic relief. At first you will probably find him annoying, but he will grow on you. At least, this happened to me.The acting is fair, but nothing special. Chris Tucker does a good job as the nutcase radioman, and Ian Holm does a pretty good job as the priest set out to save the planet. This was a very different type of role for Gary Oldman. He was still a bad guy, of course, but it was a much more comical part. It surely wasn't his best work, but it was still OK. Bruce Willis did a great job playing his part, and Milla Jovovich was excellent as the sexy but strong fifth element.The special effects were fantastic. The story to this movie is nothing big, but like I said the main purpose of this movie is for the viewer to have fun. Don't expect to do much thinking and just enjoy yourself and I'm sure you'll like this movie."
999,The Fifth Element,8," Funny and Entertaining:In the Twentieth-Third Century, the universe is threatened by Evil in a Dark Planet. The only hope for mankind is The Fifth Element, who comes to Earth every five thousand years to protect the humans with four stones of the four elements: Fire, Water, Earth and Air.A Mondoshawan spacecraft is bringing The Fifth Elemant back to Earth but it is destroyed by the evil Mangalores. However, a team of scientists use the DNA of the remains of The Fifth Element to rebuild the perfect being called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). She escapes from the laboratory and stumbles with the taxi driver and former elite commando major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) that helps her to escape from the police. Leeloo tells him that she must meet Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm ) to accomplish her mission.Meanwhile the Evil uses the greedy and cruel Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) and a team of mercenaries Mangalores to retrieve the stones and avoid the protection of Leeloo. But the skilled Korben Dallas has fallen in love with Leeloo and decides to help her to retrieve the stones.I have just seen ""The Fifth Element"" maybe for the fourth or fifth time (last time was on 16 February 2002) and I enjoyed this film the same way I did fifteen years ago. The special effects are excellent; the story if funny and entertaining; Chris Tucker steals the movie with his gay character; Bruce Willis is excellent in action films; and Milla Jovovich is impressively gorgeous. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): ""O Quinto Elemento"" (""The Fifth Element"")"
1000,The Fifth Element,10," You can tell where they are in the movie by how torn up Bruce Willis's shirt is.:For pure wacky comedy action, look no further than ""The Fifth Element"". Although I usually don't like Bruce Willis, he's really cool in this movie, as 23rd century cab driver Korben Dallas trying to save the world with super-being Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). But overall, this movie's all about one-liners (you'll know 'em when you hear 'em). AND CHRIS TUCKER IS SO DAMN FUNNY!!!!!!!!! I gotta wonder how someone could have so much energy. This is one truly great sci-fi comedy. I'll spend my whole life thinking about it and laughing.As it is, while I was in St. Petersburg, Russia, last semester, I saw a spoof of this movie on the cartoon ""Magazinchik Bo""."
1001,The Fifth Element,10," A wonderful action movie to see over and over again:I think The Fifth Element is the movie I have seen the most... It is a perfect mixture of action and comedy, science-fiction, suspense and romance. Set in a not so far future, the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars, aeroplanes that go at the speed of light, weird creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before : Good has only one weapon to defeat evil; it is composed of four stones representing the four element (water, earth, fire and air) and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. Bruce Willis (one of the best action actors of our time), Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm and Gary Oldman make the suspense even more intense. Chris Tucker is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of Luc Besson's best. I have never seen anything else like it. The costumes, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, are unbelievably imaginative and fun. They are a big part of the extravagance and originality of the movie. The score, by Eric Serra (one of my favourites) is simply a work of art. And last but not least, the special effects are absolutely excellent, adding to the quality of the movie. If you are looking for action and a good laugh, this is the film to see. But the actors are not the only things that make this film worth seeing. Click here"
1002,The Fifth Element,7," A great change of pace:Most sci-fi films try to break new ground with special effects and visual eye candy, but The Fifth Element created a whole new concept in the genre: the art-action science fiction.While this film has many flaws, particularly in the flow of the plot, visually, it surpasses most sci-fi films I have ever seen. Not even Planet of the Apes (2001) could compete with this film's cinematography. I firmly believe 1997 was a great year for this concept of film, considering the highly visual Alien Resurrection came out the same year. Hopefully, some of the more modern sci-fi films will encompass some of the visual ideals this film set forth."
1003,The Fifth Element,10," One of the most entertaining and fun sci-fi movies ever:Great movie. Almost perfect.It amuses me how so many of the critics of the time bashed it.All of the actors were perfectly cast and did a great job.Laugh out loud moments, touching moments, and just plain fun moments throughout.I think Gary Oldman made comments critical of his performance, but I loved his character."
1004,The Fifth Element,10," This movie has all the right elements!:Last night I watched ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) written /directed by Luc Besson for the first time - somehow I missed it and not being a huge fan of sci-fi, I did not search for it. Better later then never - the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself, does not take itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect mixture of Action / Adventure / Romance / Sci-Fi / Thriller/ with the comedy and the funny one, too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg might have used some ideas of ""The Fifth Element"" in his great ""Minority Report"". The story's five elements, four stones that represent water, earth, fire and air, and a perfect human creature - a girl, must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as ever doing what he does best -fighting the bad guys (ugly scary aliens and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe) and saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but the Life as we know it. Luc Besson, the director, also wrote the story and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there is so much joy in it, the joy and happiness that only can be felt in one's childhood. The visuals, the sound, and the music to the film are terrific. The costumes created by another boy-genius, ""enfant terrible"" of Paris haute couture Jean-Paul Gaultier will grab your eye and attention - so shockingly creative and unforgettable they are - the garment Milla was wearing in her first scene, for example. Who would think the wide band-aids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis's orange top that matches Milla's blinding red hair, absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) was proudly wearing? I am smiling now when I just think of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the eyes, radiant and green like a new spring grass - she was a perfect choice for a perfect creature, the Mankind's only hope for survival in the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil, Creativity and Destruction, Life and Death, Love and Hatred."
1005,The Fifth Element,10," Legendary film that has stood the test of time.:22 years later and this film is still next level compared to the best films today, even today it still plays like a new blockbuster and is excellent entertainment.
Comedy, action and sci-fi are regularly overlaid on top of each other, the volume of content this film manages to squeezes into ~120 minutes is totally amazing and waste scenes are non-existent. The comedy is actually unique and funny and it mixes well with the action. The sci-fi is great and the view of the future is still intriguing (sleeper cells in airplanes, apartments with vertical storage and reconfiguration, instant makeup devices, instant food devices, flying cars, trains that ride vertically up super tall skyscrapers, smart rifles, nuclear powered jetliners, medical devices that can reconstruct human bodies, etc). The acting is great and the characters really come across as real. The action is excellent and is greatly enriched by the previously mentioned overlays.This should really be taught as an example in film school of how to do movies right."
1006,Man of Steel,9," Watched recently and forgot how good it is:An epic Superman film one of the best ones that is incredibly well directed by Zack Snyder! Goes from explaining how Clark/Superman gets sent to earth because of his parents to the right amount of character development with Lois Lane and power along with epic action sequences. I've seen a few times even then I really liked it, this adaption deserves plenty of praise all around. The cast is excellent, beautiful cinematography, amazing story, emotions on point, and superb action!"
1007,Man of Steel,9," Henry makes the best Superman!:I do agree this movie could be better like Lois being more believable and it not being so loud but overall it's a really good movie! Henry is the best Superman and I grew up watching Christopher Reed as Superman and now it would be impossible to watch anyone else as Superman! Henry has the perfect look, has the perfect personality being humble, intelligent and level headed and just comes across as SUPER!I won't go into details of the movie because it's been 9 years since the release and others have outlined the storyline many times.Man of Steel is entertaining and that's what we want and thankfully there isn't are no woke messages which is even better and we can't get away from now!"

1009,Man of Steel,8," Very Good!:So we are looking at essentially a remake of Superman (nothing wrong with that).
So how does it compare? Favourably.The original is perhaps a little softer, more romantic and more idyllic whereas the remake is darker, richer and a little more interesting.2 changes that worked for me, the origin part of the story on Krypton which is much more expansive (creating more of a universe feel, literally) and the extended character of Superman Senior. Brando was the quintessential sci-fi 'head in a bottle' character using him to explain Supe's back story in the original, Crowe's character came full combat ready and I think it added well to the overall story.Really enjoyable effort that sits well as a representative of the DC universe :)"
1010,Man of Steel,8," The Day I Stopped Trusting Critics:This movie was dishonestly mauled by critics and reviewers simply because it was directed by Snyder. Watching this again in 2020, I have to say this will go down as a classic in years to come. It's an absolute blast from start to finish and is one of the most loyal adaptations and faithful to the Superman lore found in DC comics. One of its greatest achievements was the magnificent depiction of Krypton and giving Zod the gravitas and motivation that he lacked in Superman II. You felt empathy for him. Shannon was outstanding in his portrayal of Zod; up there with Ledger's Joker.I remember people actually complained about the level of destruction in this movie and the excessive use of special effects, but for me this is what makes a Superman movie. Take off your nostalgia tinted glasses and watch this with an open mind. This is the greatest Superman movie bar none."
1011,Man of Steel,10, 2021 and still one of the best DC films:Hands down the best Superman movie out there. Way ahead of its time.
1012,Man of Steel,8," Ignore the critics:I am old enough to have seen the original 2 Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and the idea of combining them is great. Henry Cavill is a better Superman, Amy Adams is a better Lois Lane, the script is far stronger, the baddies are more believable, I honestly can't understand the negatives; with the exception of the first 20 minutes, which just didn't work. A great attempt, far better than most DC movies, except the Nolan ones."
1013,Man of Steel,10," An Epic Ride!:At first I was very nervous at the prospect of another Superman movie. Especially considering how horrible ""Superman Returns"" was; however, ""Man of Steel"" was a roller coaster of a ride as we not only witness Kal El's (Clark Kent's) origins, but we are shown Superman the way he is supposed to be.With expert direction brought to us by Zack Snyder and the assistance of Christopher Nolan, ""Man of Steel"" is packed full of action and emotional depth. No Superman movie has ever come close to achieving the atmosphere illustrated in the comics or the cartoon series until Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"". Sure it has a lot of action, but anyone who is a true Superman fan knows that Kal El's battles were almost always explosively long. Furthermore, the biblical metaphors were absolutely brilliant! As Superman was intended to be portrayed as a ""Christ Like"" figure, you see his journey in ""Man of Steel"" not all that much different from the New Testament. (Ex: When Clark Kent asked the priest for advice, behind him was a stained glass window of Christ praying to His Father before He was arrested and crucified. Next scene Clark Kent willingly submits himself to be arrested, ascends into the ""heavens"", and than descends in a crucified form) As Superman's story is not about becoming the best, but an immigrant facing the challenge of home VS heritage, we see Zack Snyder's portrayal of Superman reflect the ""Man of Steel"" originally designed by Joseph Shuster. Furthermore, who could forget such actors like Henry Cavill (Clark Kent),or Amy Adams (Lois Lane). Every actor in this movie left their mark, but I needed very little convincing to believe that Cavill was the face of Superman, or that Adams could be a persuasive Lois Lane. And although I am not particularly a fan of Michael Shannon, he was the perfect General Zod. With the level of ferocity Shannon provided, not to mention his one liners, this was by far his best role yet!This movie soared through my expectations and it will be the first time I ever give a Superman movie a perfect 10!"
1014,Man of Steel,8," What Superman needed:On the planet Krypton, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is killed by General Zod (Michael Shannon) after he launches his son with the Codex of Kryptonian genetics to earth. Zod and his men are sentenced and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. Soon after Krypton implodes. The baby is raised by the Kents (Diane Lane, Kevin Costner). Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) grows up to be a drifter hiding his powers from everybody. Then a spaceship is discovered in 18,000 years old ice. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is there but Clark pilots it away. It's an earlier scout ship that the Kryptonians sent out. Kryptonians fell into population control and they abandoned space exploration. When Zod arrives on earth, Kal-El is the only hope.This is a darker Superman which is exactly what the franchise needs. This should have been done by Bryan Singer for his reboot rather than trying to copy the Richard Donner version. This is not the Norman Rockwell painting version. Clark Kent is scruffy fisherman and not the boy scout. Even Pa Kent advises against using his powers when his schoolmates' lives are at stake. This is a true reboot.The action looks quite good. Everything is expertly made. There is the Battlestar Galactica TV style of zooming in on the action. The designs look amazing. The hand to hand combat is pretty much all CGI. On one hand, I understand the superpower nature can only be done by CGI. On the other hand, I always prefer real stunts for human size combat. If there is one possible complain, the action doesn't take enough breaks. The audience needs a few more quiet breaks to catch their breath. The action may be too overwhelming.Quite frankly, Superman no longer has the duo personality and he is simply the angst ridden hero. Henry Cavill does a solid job delivering the needed performance. It's not until the end does he become nerdy reporter. The brilliant Michael Shannon does a superb job as General Zod. Overall, this is a solid launching point for a new series of DC comics movies."
1015,Man of Steel,9," What's with all the hate?! I LOVE MAN OF STEEL!!!:Am I one of the few people who actually love this movie? Man of Steel has beautiful visuals, an amazing cast ensemble, and action scenes to blow you away. The story is better than that awful Superman Returns movie and it's like the actors are doing their best. It's no Wonder Woman or Aquaman, but its a very fun watch and completely unforgettable!!"
1016,Man of Steel,10," Best Superman to Date:I love Superman. Every version. I'll defend Superman 4 if you want? But this is the definitive version. The version I've always dreamed of seeing - the version I'd write if I could have. Challenging, thought-provoking, insightful. Not there to be a poster child, but rather to be an inspiration. Inspiration comes through internal struggle and strife, not through BANG BANG, POW POW. I wish DC had more faith in this storyline - cause it was clearly going somewhere wonderful. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut."
1017,Man of Steel,10," The New Superman - a modern look at the greatest hero:To be honest, I didn't really wait for this movie, being very impressed by Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. For some reason, I thought that such a furore could not be repeated by director Zack Snyder, unknown to me at that time. Oh, how I changed my mind after I left the cinema. Snyder gave the world a great Man of Steel.What immediately catches the eye is the thoughtful world of the planet Krypton, where the film meets the viewer. It is clear with what love the director approached the project. He showed, albeit briefly, but the utopian world that is doomed to perish. Beautiful futuristic scenery and costumes, its own culture of relationships between characters - all this perfectly demonstrates an alien world.The characters are perfectly spelled out, you understand the motivation of everyone. Superman feels like an outcast, a loner, an outsider. Throughout the film, the viewer sees how he is trying to find his place in an alien world, where he is essentially god.General Zod is a great villain. Snyder and the screenwriters perfectly showed his motivation, desire to save and revive his home. After all, as he himself declares, this is his main mission in this world.Lois Lane is just fine. Contrary to popular opinion based on comics, here the journalist appears to be a rather modest person. However, she is ready to stand up for her interests, enter into the position of others and empathize. Amy Adams is great in this role. The actress shows a completely unusual Lois, it's interesting to look at her.Clark's parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, demonstrate exactly what is expected of them on the screen. They prepare their son for the human world as best they can and try to protect him from all adversities. Clark's relationship with his father and their evolution are well shown. As a result, you realize for yourself that with age such a connection only grows stronger. And if conflicts are frequent in adolescence, then closer to thirty Clark misses his father very much, he lacks his wise advice.The visual component is beyond praise. Snyder has always shown himself to be a great visionary. Every frame, every scene - everything is verified and perfect. The presence of computer effects organically fit into the whole picture of the narrative. The viewer is watching a fantastic movie and is absolutely ready to see what the creators offer him.The musical accompaniment from my beloved Hans Zimmer is great. As always, he bypassed himself by creating a futuristic, slightly apocalyptic soundtrack that flows into the necessary scenes with powerful notes. However, there are also very soft melodies that are immediately associated with the parents of a superhero, a farm and something at home.The film is involuntarily compared to the classic pictures about Superman. And although Christopher Reeve was great in this image, Henry Cavill presented it perfectly. His Superman perfectly demonstrates modernity, he is young and hot, still little experienced, but still on guard of justice.The film looks in one breath, the timing of almost two and a half hours is not felt. The story is great, it gives a great start to the whole cinematic universe and looks great as an independent completed story.10 out of 10."
1018,Man of Steel,10," Ahead of its time:I never had the opportunity to see this film in theatres, though, after my first viewing at home, I was instantly blown away by the tone, visuals, soundtrack, story, performance, thriller and action to this film.Man of steel truely felt as though it was an alien invasion film set in our present time.Superman has literally searched to find himself and when he does, he must learn not only learn his origins, though his abilities and how to use them.He was bound to question himself and make mistakes along the way and following his journey is something I'm extremely excited for.Most certainly a superhero film for adults."
1019,Man of Steel,8," The soundtrack is epic.:Henry Cavil is my Superman. He's the best Superman ever. Interesting story, with deep meanings and realism. The camera work is not so good, some parts is good but others it feels like a Michael Bay film. The action sequences are pretty intense and excessive. However the soundtrack is probably the best thing of the movie. I've told it again, Hans Zimmer is a brilliant worker in music. The music names of the movie that I really love is:Flight
Sent here for a reason
If you love these people
What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?Look to the starsJust beautifully pieces in my ears. Overall the movie could have been much better, but I appreciate that it's underrated. For me, the best scene of the entire movie is when Superman learns how to fly in the first time. Just, a masterpiece scene."
1020,Man of Steel,8," ""Welcome to the Planet"".:I'll be taking a somewhat different approach I think, than most reviewers here. When it comes to super-hero movies, I'm not dazzled all that much by the over the top action sequences and the inevitable destruction they bring to the big screen. I'm more into character development and a compelling story line, so an early scene on the planet Krypton really intrigued me. It had to do with the Kryptonian high council and the way they saw themselves versus the population as a whole. The idea was best expressed by Jor-El (Russell Crowe), who decried a society that had lost it's element of choice. The elites of Krypton made decisions for the entire planet based on their status as 'knowing' what was best for their citizens. It sounded very much to me like a recipe for Communism, whereas Jor-El voiced his defiance in terms of a child aspiring to something greater, he saw individuals having the potential to be a force for good in the world, virtually impossible in the command and control society Krypton had evolved into. I thought that concept was rather fascinating, since you don't hear that very much from our own political leaders today.I've long ago given up on the idea that modern films will honor the continuity of characters that originated decades ago, which makes it interesting to consider the origin of the 'S' on Superman's uniform. In both the Richard Donner directed ""Superman"" from 1978 and this picture, the 'S' symbol originated on the planet Krypton, once again with the character Jor-El. I believe he even intimated in this story that with Earth's atmosphere, Kal-El would grow up to be a super man among men. If my recollection of reading Silver Age Superman comics is correct, the 'S' was originally an idea that Ma Kent came up with when she fashioned his first set of clothes from the wreckage salvaged from the rocket that brought him to Earth. The rationale one has to accept in these reboots is is that Earthlings would interpret 'Superman' in the same manner and spell it with just the right letter.So is Superman someone to be trusted or feared? The film seems to suggest that people's reaction to Superman would initially be one of fear, presumably fear of the unknown. There's some merit in that, but with all of his good works on Earth, I'm not sure I agree that one had to be wary of Superman's motives when challenged by General Zod (Michael Shannon). What doesn't help though, in giving movie goers what they want, is for Superman to engage in a battle with his enemy that takes out entire city blocks. That's an area that also diverges significantly from the early canon which insisted that Superman never harm or kill a living being. I know, times and tastes change, so belaboring this point is a meaningless exercise.I think for my last point I'd like to make an observation that definitely suggests a post 9/11 influence. Prior to that horrendous event, epic battles didn't feature the same kind of destructive scenes that are on display here (as well as other recent movies). I refer to those scenes that elicit a subliminal recognition of the horror that occurred on that day, specifically to those rolling dust clouds that unwind down streets surrounded on both sides by canyon walls of high rise buildings, trapping the destruction within their outer walls. If you think back, probably the first time you ever saw something like that was when the Twin Towers fell and the images of destruction were broadcast for the entire world to see.So my viewing of the picture the other day was in preparation for ""Dawn of Justice"" which follows the events here in linear fashion. I suspect and expect that the action in that film will attempt to outdo what we've seen here in terms of size and scope. Not completely necessary for this viewer, but I'll be there."
1021,Man of Steel,10," Criminally Underrated:It is the most criminally Underrated superhero movie ever. It's also the movie that made me love Superman .Zack Snyder best work and Hans Zimmer was amazing. Visuals , Storytelling and Action scene were top notch .Too bad this movie did not get a proper sequel"
1022,Man of Steel,8," How Could They Do this to Superman?!?!:As usual, I find that for some when a movie is made about a super-hero, it has to fit into some pigeonhole, determined by years of comic books. God forbid that someone tries to find a different angle or a new approach. As usual, there is all this nit-picking about details that don't seem real. For heaven's sake, the guy can fly, comes as a baby from another planet, and can go back and forth in time. Let's check the reality thing right now. There have been so many reviews of this that I doubt I can contribute much that is new, but for me, the guy was a multi-dimensional character who has to deal with a hand that is dealt to him. I'm waiting for Superman XIX, ""Superman on the Psychiatrist's Couch."" The guy must have incredible angst during his private moments and feel the weight of the world. Anyway, the acting is quite good, there is lots of action, and under the circumstances, he seems pretty real."
1023,Man of Steel,10," It's all about Henry Cavill!:It was easy to rate this film.... All I had to do was feast my old eyes on Henry Cavill...I actually fell in love with him in the movie, 'The Count of Monte Cristo', many years ago...he's only gotten better looking with age.....Forget the special effects, storyline & direction....it's all about Henry! And for that reason, this movie is a 10!"
1024,Man of Steel,10, Visually and emotionally stunning:By far the most epic and iconic visual experience for a comic movie. Totally recommended.
1025,Man of Steel,10," Best Superman Movie Ever Made:This is what I've been waiting for my whole life - a Superman film that tackles big issues, big ideas and takes risks. I've liked every superman film I've ever seen - but this one felt like it finally lived up to the potential of the character. 11 stars if I could."
1026,Man of Steel,8, SPOILERS:this movie is incredibly underrated!:Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible.
1027,Man of Steel,9," Cavill is superb  supporting performances are great  but production and cinematography seal the win:To this day I recall how phenomenal and chills-inducing the original teaser trailer was. What we got was everything promised and more. Russell Crowe as Superman's father was excellent, and foremost I must say that the script was amazing. Michael Shannon as Zod was awesome to the very end, and Henry Cavill was simply incredible in such a role, powerfully eliciting various emotions all while being easy on the eyes. The interspersed flashbacks were done very well. Music was great. Produced by Christopher Nolan? Clearly. The film is gorgeous but has this gritty, dramatic overtone that, when paired with certain cinematographic moments, have the potential of triggering chills or, with me personally, even tears. And I'm not a major Superman fan! With all my praise, the only real gripe I had with the movie was, ironically, most (but not all) of the action; when Superman fought Zod and co, it was a mess of flying and zipping through the air or buildings. Between headache-inducing and monotonous to watch. Which I think goes to show just how impactful of an origin story this was."
1028,Man of Steel,9," amazing:An amazing movie, henry cavill is immaculate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the acting and cgi are top notch.an amazing movie, henry cavill is immaculate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the acting and cgi are top notchan amazing movie, henry cavill is immaculate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the acting and cgi are top notch.an amazing movie, henry cavill is immaculate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the acting and cgi are top notch.an amazing movie, henry cavill is immaculate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the acting and cgi are top notch.An amazing movie, henry cavill is immaculate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the acting and cgi are top notch."
1029,Man of Steel,9," Aged really well:I remember watching this when it came out and thought it was mediocre, but in rewatch last night I really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect but It was refreshing to watch a more serious hero film after a decade of MCU films.The action scenes were awesome, the speed and power of SM and The Kryptionians were awesome and done really well, the scale of destruction and the feeling that there was something at stake was met. I compare it to the latest Marvel films and they have become to paint by numbers, you never really feel the world is in danger or the world even cares anymore. Cavhill is Superman and it is going to be near impossible to ever replace him with anyone better."
1030,Man of Steel,9," Incredibly epic origin story:Man of Steel is an incredibly epic origin story for Superman that's emotional and action packed, even though there is a little too much destruction in the third act. Henry Cavill is great as Superman. Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon are all great as well. Zack Snyder's direction is fantastic and the film is extremely well filmed with amazing action sequences. It's well paced and the CG is consistently stunning. The music by Hans Zimmer is incredible."
1031,Significant Other,6," Interesting concept that brings too little.:Interesting concept that is kept mysterious in previews, but quickly spoils the overall concept in the first 10 minutes (or suggests it loudly). Still, there is a mild edge as we try to understand what is happening. After things are clear on the plot, this turns into a mind game psychological thriller. But it lacks enough tension to be a thriller. Maika Moore and Jake Lacy play off each other well, making their couple in tension highly believable. But, the movie overall boils down to a very small point, and this was underwhelming for me. The movie is less mysterious when watching than what the previews suggest leaving a horror and thriller fan disappointed."
1032,Significant Other,9," Why you shouldn't listen to the negative reviews...:I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews from critics calling it a ""waste of time"", and audience reviews of 3/5 stars. But remember, people tend to dislike things that are different. And this film is definitely different.As a Shudder user, I see SO many 1 star reviews of films that I LOVE, saying that they're ""boring"" or ""not horror movies"" (it got so frustrating, I stopped reading them). I've come to the conclusion that the average mainstream-movie watching person only defines a ""horror movie"" as one with a monster/demon/ghost/psycho killer, 90 minutes of interchangeable jump scares (usually of the antagonist appearing BEHIND the characters where only the audience can see), and a high body count.So brilliant films like Garland's Annihilation, Strickland's In Fabric, Benson & Moorhead's Resolution, or in this case, Olsen & Berk's Significant Other, get passed up because they aren't understood, and therefore raves about, by the casual movie-going, mainstream majority.I loved this film because it had all of the criteria you'd hope for in the ever-evolving horror genre... tension, suspense, atmosphere, a fitting score, and even a twist you don't see coming. Just because there aren't gory kill scenes every 7-10 minutes by some grotesque creature does NOT disqualify a film from being classified as horror.So if you truly appreciate horror as an artistic form of film art, something that can make you feel unease and suspense while making you think, then give this a shot and form your own opinion. Fans of horror films like Pontypool, Braid, Hereditary, Come True, or any of the aforementioned films will definitely love and appreciate this one."
1033,Significant Other,6," If You Go Down to the Woods Today...:Ruth and Harry venture into the woods for a bit of a ramble, although if they knew what was ahead I'm sure they wouldn't have taken such a gamble, especially as Ruth has some serious anxiety that she struggles to overcome, and often relies on pills to stop the depth of her despairing, downward plumb, all brought about because of a traumatic childhood, that to this day leaves her confused and misunderstood, as she knows that people can change, their emotions and personalities can range, one minute this, the next minute that, sometimes calm and caring, the next getting ready for combat and overbearing. Suffice to say the lovers walk on the wild side reveals more about themselves than they could ever have imagined."
1034,Significant Other,6," A harmless film that should entertain you plenty:Even though 'Significant Other' has its flaws, I respect a lot about this film. It had an interesting premise with some subtle and clever twists and it got in and got out with a short runtime.The problem this film has is its middle. It feels like it establishes a good tone early. Pretty dark and serious, then all of a sudden things become wacky and it feels like it is going for laughs (I'm torn as to whether this was intentional or it was just coming across this way).It's pretty hard to dislike a film like this though. It's not preachy and trying to shove a message down your throat. It simply wants to entertain you. I'll give it a 6, but a part of me would like to give it a 7. 6/10."
1035,Significant Other,7," Add Horror to the Genres List:I don't know why Horror's not included in the ""Genres"" list; I would call this more horror with sci-fi elements than the other way around.Trying to think of what other films of which this one reminded me, and the closest I could come up with was Under the Skin. While not as creepy and much more overtly explained than that 2013 Scarlett Johansson film, I found definite similarities. To elaborate more on this would be bordering even more on spoiler territory; suffice to say that this film's title is quite the double entendre.I'm liking Maika Monroe more each time I see her, and she does not disappoint here.As a horror enthusiast, I find the present rating of 5.7 for this film far lower than it merits. I found it far superior to the recent Hellraiser reboot and, unlike that film, look forward to watching this one again."
1036,Significant Other,," Enjoyable:I wanted to see this as soon as I saw that Maika was in it because she is fast becoming my new favorite actress, particularly as she seems to be the go-to for good horror/thriller films, and she has not let me down yet. There are some minor issues with the movie itself; some pacing problems - this could have been a bit shorter overall, especially if the twist had come earlier, and once there, I
loved the surprisingly humorous turn the story took, but I was left wanting just a few more shocks and surprises. The twist reminded me of the twist in Malignant, which I did not guess, and which then signaled utter craziness to come, so I was waiting for that to happen, but it was on a much lesser scale..still, this is enjoyable and unexpected, and best of all, it fooled me."
1037,Significant Other,4," Had potential but was ultimately disappointing:This movie starts off with potential but the story crashes. The setting is good, the cinematography is good, and even the acting is decent. Where it falls short is the story. The story disappoints and the ending is just plain irritating.A lot of attention is focused on Maika Monroe, because she is gorgeous. No matter how many days she is in the woods, she still looks perfect.It starts off with what is clearly an alien landing in the forest. So, we are set up for what appears to be an alien/creature/monster movie. Next, we have a couple going on a backpacking trip. They have apparently been together for 6 years and Ruth has some fears/anxiety that her boyfriend Harry is trying to help her overcome.We learn early on that Ruth has some mental struggles, particularly with anxiety disorder and goes pops pills pretty regularly. Uncomfortable in the woods, Ruth sees a deer at night that she believes is watching her. Later, they find what appears to be the same deer, dead in some kind of cocoon. The movie does a good job giving the feeling of uneasiness in the woods, like there is something else out there and our two characters are isolated. There are some unusual sounds/growls here and there that add to it nicely.Harry tries to propose to her on a dramatic cliff and she turns him down, making things very awkward between them. So, they each go off for walks on their own. Ruth finds a cave with some blue glowing liquid, looking similar to the blood from Predator. She turns around and screams and then we don't know what happens.Harry finds her in the woods, looking out of it and takes her back to camp. She's acting weird making us think maybe she is possessed by something. She tells Harry that she wants him to propose to her again on the cliff. He does. This time she says yes and then throws him off the cliff. What! Okay, I am intrigued now. Please story...go somewhere good!Ruth runs away and finally passes out. Other hikers find her and try to help her, but she is sort of a zombie. Suddenly she grabs their knife as Harry come out of the trees looking for her. Okay...clearly this is not the Harry that came to the woods with her. The other hikers try to intervene, but Harry turns into a discount Robert Patrick as the T-1000 and his finger turns into a long blade and he kills them. So.....the alien replicated Harry but is actually liquid metal?So, we get a flashback to the cave. Ruth saw Harry dead and, in a cocoon, so she knew the Harry that was back at camp was some kind of alien replicant.The alien tries to kill Ruth but can't. Since the alien replicated Harry, it also has Harry's feeling for Ruth. The alien explains it is a scout that is supposed to ""report back."" We don't know what the alien is scouting for or what it is supposed to report or what the alien intent is. However, the alien decides it wants to take the hot Earth girl off world in its ship and find a quiet planet somewhere because of what will happen to Earth. It doesn't tell us what or why.Ruth fights and gets away, but the alien captures her and takes her to the cave and begins replicating her. So, the alien becomes a dual replicant of Harry and Ruth. However, Ruth's anxiety disorder is too much for the alien to handle in a sudden rush and while incapacitated, she bashes its head in (like completely) and runs off and drives away. So, the alien isn't actually liquid metal like the T-1000 even though it can turn its fingers into swords of sorts. However.....the alien apparently has magic healing powers to recover from such mortal injury and reconstructs its smashed brains and skull. Okay...that was stupid. It calls her on the radio and as she is driving away, we see what is apparently the alien invasion force landing.So, everything that Ruth goes through is ultimately pointless as this invasion force is shown at the end. Did the alien scout report something back? Apparently, but what was it? The invasion force got there pretty quickly. The alien replicated a deer and then Harry. It didn't have much interaction with humanity. So, what the hell did it report? Couldn't have been much.There is no explanation as to what the aliens want, so the movie is ultimately unsatisfying."
1038,Significant Other,7," A wild ride:This movie is not what it seems. From the title and description I thought this movie was a movie about a haunting or demonic possession. The commercial made it look kind of like a Blair witch type of movie. The first 30 seconds of the movie made it obvious that this was not the case. This is in fact an alien movie. I don't particularly like alien movies they're just not my thing, but after reading critic reviews I decided to give it a chance. With this movie I think a new genre was discovered Sci-Fi horror comedy. This movie breaks all the cliches of the usual thriller genre. Nothing is as it seems and every time you think you have the movie figured out something else wild happens. At one point I was convinced this movie was a parody. I kind of love this movie and what they went for. I know the movie is supposed to have deeper meanings and what not, but as someone who is not a serious person I enjoyed it as a Thriller comedy about aliens and the mystery of love. The first third of the movie had me on edge, the second third had me laughing, and the final third had me yelling at the screen. Once the twists and turns start they don't stop so just enjoy this wild ride for what it is."
1039,Significant Other,7," An enjoyable horror/sci-fi:The movie begins with (what appears to be) a meteorite coming down in the woods.We then meet Harry and Ruth, a couple, who are coming to the woods for a camping and hiking break. Ruth does not seem keen and appears to be carrying substantial trauma. Harry is quite unsympathetic and pushes Ruth to accompany him even though she seems very nervous and reluctant.During the few days Ruth does appear distant and anxious, Harry really doesn't help matters. Ruth wanders off to go pee and finds a cave. On further investigation she finds a pool of iridescent blue gloop.Next thing we see Ruth luring Harry to his death!The setting and claustrophobic atmosphere is gripping. Miriam steals the show completely. Harry's character is annoying and, to me, their relationship just didn't seem real. Unless it was supposed to be unbalanced and with Harry being a selfish arse. That confused me a bit. However it's still a great new horror/sci-fi."
1040,Significant Other,5," Going on a hike in a national park is never a good idea:This isn't a groundbreaking sci-fi thriller but I have to admit I enjoyed the first 2/3 of it. It's a low-budget, slow-burner production but definitely worth watching if you lower your expectations. As we all know by now, hiking is always a bad idea and unfortunately the first scene of the movie gives it away. Not completely, but you sort of know something is coming. Although there are some surprisingly good twists, the suspense dropped significantly when the ""mystery"" was revealed. The acting is hard to comment on as the script doesn't demand much from the actors, but all in all, a good movie to watch on a rainy Sunday night."
1041,Significant Other,6," This took too long to get going...:Then once it did, it was actually really fun and rather good. It would probably make a good short story but stretching out to a full length feature was a step too far. Nothing wrong with the performances, I have seen Maika in several things and she is definitely a star for the future, and all other actors were just fine. The special effects were good apart from the last cucoon scene where you could tell she was just wearing a suit. But, it's a good enought time passer, I just wish there was more in the first 45 minutes because if there had been, it would have been a solid seven. A good effort though."
1042,Significant Other,2," Horror? Thriller? More like a tragic comedy of unforced errors:Starts off suspenseful enough, but the cliches seem a bit forced. Pregnant with double entendres throughout, to which you can play along with the writers, ""sure but just wait"". Then they have to explain that this is really about the black (or blue) goo body snatchers, who happened to also arrive in the Mork+Mindy egg shaped space craft. For Maika Monroe seemed like more of the same, type cast, accidentally suspenseful thriller genre. For Jake Lacy, also seems like a type cast comedy of errors, especially once the whole body snatcher double motif was backtracked and explained, for his role in The White Lotus. If you have the time maybe it is worth passing on this one, but I'm not sure the journey, let alone destination, is that satisfying."
1043,Significant Other,5," Not scary  not tense  not funny  not much of anything really:As ""Significant Other"" (2022 release; 84 min) opens, a couple (we later learn they are Harry and Ruth) are on their way to Red Ridge Trail in the Pacific Northwest for a weekend of backpacking. This is Ruth's first time doing this. As they head out, it isn't long before there seems to be something different about this trail... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from frequent collaborators (and co-writers and co-directors) Dan Berk and Robert Olsen (""Villains""). The premise of this movie looks decent enough on paper: a couple goes on a backpacking weekend trip in the remote Northwest Pacific, so what could go wrong? Except that when you actually watch the movie, this premise turns out to be paper-thin and the actual implementation leaves you gasping for air when it goes off the rails and strains all credibility in the movie's second half. The two lead performers, Maika Monroe (as Ruth) and Jake ""The White Lotus"" Lacy (as Harry), try the best they can with the weak material they are given. The outdoor scenery is all but the third character in the film. Beware, though, as quite a few scenes are filmed in the dark (so as to make it look scarier?). In the end, this movie is not scary, not tense, not funny, not credible, and not much of anything really. It just is. The main reason I still give it 5 stars is that this flew by very quickly (if you discount the opening and closing credit, it lasts roughly 1 hr. 15 min.).""Significant Other"" premiered recently on Paramount+ and is now available to stream on demand. If you are looking for a ""(ho-hum) scary"" movie, I'd readily suggest you check this out with low expectations, and then draw your own conclusion."
1044,Significant Other,4," Terrible:You know when you watch a film and really dislike a character? Well that is how I felt about the female lead. Very unlikable and unnecessarily morose. Drives out to go on a long walk but then won't get out of the car? That is dumb. I couldn't work out if she had autism or was just annoying, it is the latter. The scenery was the standout here, lush and provided a great backdrop but boy oh boy was the rest lame. Agree with other comments that this is more horror than sci-fi, I actually didn't make it past the first 30 mins, there was nothing happening other than lots of blank staring from the female lead. Boring."
1045,Significant Other,8," A new take on the monster movie:Comet comes down in the woods. An odd tentacle grabs a deer. Couple hike in the same woods.Kind of slow for 30 minutes as we go through her anxiety and panic attacks and him wanting to marry her. The gal from It Follows. He's a good character actor.Something happens then and about another 10 minutes until two good twists in a row. More running around and a unique but brief final battle. Opens itself up wide for a sequel at the end.Brief but effective character sketches that accentuate the emotional. Slow pace, though, and nothing remarkable about the directing from the two who also wrote/directed the very good Villains. But their writing in this was good."
1046,Significant Other,4," Significantly other than what I thought it would be:What was I thinking it might be? I'm not exactly sure, but not this. I live in Oregon and love the forests and trails. I liked Maika Monroe in The Guest, Tau, Greta, Villains and The Watcher was okay. I have no idea why she would do this. Maybe she had a 3-movie deal and owed the studio one? I've heard of that before but I have no clue.This was right along the lines of a SyFy movie, which are usually pretty bad and this one is no different, complete with cheesy effects. I thought it would be something a bit more serious but turned out being B movie schlock. I'm not even sure why I'm giving it a 4. This seemed like it had a good premise and I waited a little while to see it. It's unfortunate that it was such a dud."
1047,Significant Other,3," Where did these high reviews come from?:A middle aged man drags against her will a grumpy woman who looks young enough to be his daughter on a backpacking trip in the woods. She hates the very idea of camping and is clearly miserable as he leads her through the woods and subjects her to the fun of setting up camp. The following day she's even more miserable, and sensing his chance, the psychopath proposes. She rebuffs his laughable advance by having some sort of seizure.Let's pause here and consider what we have seen. Two miserable people: one because a kidnapped wet blanket is ruining an activity he clearly enjoys, and the other for allowing herself to spend time in the woods with a man she has no emotional connection or chemistry with. Are we having fun yet?An alien creature from a meteorite that landed during the opening credits appears and does its best to inject some sort of life into the proceedings. It fails miserably because we don't care about these people.The male lead actor did a credible job with what little he was given to work with. The female lead actor was godawful: expressionless, wooden, oozing the charisma and acting ability of a dime store mannequin. He acted circles around her. It reminded me of those dance shows that have the professional dancer do all the work while the star stands idly by looking embarrassed.Three stars is overly generous."
1048,Significant Other,9," A good thriller with a twist:First, this is similar to ""Annihilation (2018)"" and ""Prospect (2018)"" in that they're slow-moving sci-fi thrillers. So if you liked those, you'll probably like this.I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about this movie and came out of it pleasantly surprised. I watch a lot of movies while I work, so more often than not, I'm disappointed in movies (because most are just horrible). This one stands out as one of the better new ones I've watched this year.This is a slow-paced sci-fi thriller. Emphasize ""slow"", but not really in a bad way. The scenery was beautiful while the plot gives you just enough to nibble on periodically to keep you really interested and then hits you with an ""ah ha"" kind of twist that I didn't see coming. The dialogue and acting is good and I was left questioning practically everything that was happening onscreen until the twist/reveal. I did also enjoy the zoomed-in view on the theme of the movie... taking a look at just a couple of people in a remote area in one part of the country. I imagine many of these kinds of stories happened in this universe that would also be compelling.The gore and scary stuff was pretty creepy and felt unique and clever. The lead character was somewhat unlikable, but it was her character flaws that played a vital role at the end of the movie, so the way she is was intentional.Personally, I love the way it ended. The plot gave us plenty reasons it would end the way it did, and yet I somehow I still believed throughout the movie that it wouldn't end that way.... and when it was over, I still felt just as satisfied. Was worth my time.Sequel? Sequel?"
1049,Significant Other,4," The forest was the star:9/10 for the forest and cinematography which was very polished. Apart from one scene which had half a face cover half the shot and a deep focus into the background..nice for a film poster, but way too artsy fartsy in the film itself..just takes you out of the story and reminds you ""oh yeah im watching a film!""
But then again, come the 48th minute, comes the ""really? Too far, too stupid, time to hit the stop button on this"".Up until then it was a slow burn, enough to keep you interested type of film. Though I still did not care about either of the main characters. In fact both of them were annoying in their own ways, a too needy boyfriend and a morose unenthusiastic girlfriend.Go watch An American Werewolf in London instead."
1050,Significant Other,," I've seen everything and this goes in the fail pile:Just scanned the glowing reviews. I assume they were written by 14-15 year olds. No insult to kids, but this movie is so incredibly dull and dumb.I usually like the two leads in other films.Based on the previews I thought I was in for a treat.Thought it was a bad sign when it instantly telegraphed an alien event within first 30 seconds of the movie.Next up I was confused how Jake Lacy suddenly seems like a sad middle aged man while Maika is youthful as ever.It felt more like a kidnapper or Dad dragging a girl to the woods than a romantic couple on fun camping weekend.Just all in all dreadful.If you want a good flick with Maika check out the indie film Bokeh."
1051,Significant Other,8," Top Notch Science Fiction Thriller!!! Keeps you guessing from start to finish!!:Significant Other showcases powerhouse performances from Maika Monroe and Jake Lacey. The film follows a young couple during a hike in a strange and isolated forest. That's pretty much all that can be said without giving anything away. Significant Other definitely is the type of film that keeps you glued to the screen. Science Fiction fans will love this as it creates a perfect blend of paranoia and terror, as we follow this young couple who begin uncovering strange and sinister things, that not only threaten them, but also everyone on Earth. The strong performances by its lead actors definitely keeps your attention, Jeff Lacey especially brings his own brand of creep factor to the role.Overall, Significant Other is a worthwhile indie thriller with enough twists and turns to make it a memorable film."
1052,Significant Other,7," Different and fun:I won't overuse the term slow burn, but I will say the last 45 minutes are quite a surprise based on the first 45. Maika Monroe is very talented and Jake Lacy gives off Ben Affleck vibes in this short solid film. I am a sucker for films in this genre. I don't want to say what that genre is or name other films like it because I would have to mark this review as containing spoilers, but it makes for a film with some great twists.It tries and somewhat succeeds on being a mediation about the meaning of love and if that sounds a little boring and cerebral, trust me, it isn't. In the second half you will laugh and gasp and probably be very glad you stuck with the story.Nothing great, but pretty solid entertainment, that at the end of the day, feels like a setup for a bigger and better sequel. It may be praise enough to simply say, I hope I am right about the sequel."
1053,Significant Other,5," So much wasted potential:Man this film had SO potential right up until the actual ""twist"". It's not that the twist is particularly bad it's just after the reveal of what's ""actually"" going on the film just doesn't know what it wants to be.Are we watching a survival horror or apocalyptic sci fi film? Personally I think they should've stuck with the survival horror throughout because they nailed that part. The sci fi stuff is an interesting idea but man it just completely falls flat and comes across as cheesy and almost comedic at times. The acting is pretty solid except after the guy ""changes roles"". I just couldn't take it serious after that.The film builds a decent creepy atmosphere but then decides it wants to become ""invasion of the body snatchers"" halfway through and it just doesn't work. 5/10."
1054,Significant Other,3," Had to turn it off :(:First, I am a HUGE SciFi Horror Fan so I was all in right from the start when I saw the ad for this on Paramount+.As I was watching I thought to myself AND said to my Husband ""I would have NEVER gone backpacking/camping in the first place"". (I'm not outdoorsy so it didn't seem right). If she's so full of Anxiety, the last place she'd want to be is in the scary woods with no Cell Service! Where's the Satellite Phone Ruth?It was VERY VERY Slow. I really wanted to bag the movie but Hub said ""let's give it 10 more minutes"". I put a 10 minute Timer on to give it one last gasp. SPOILER: when Ruth asked to go back up to the scenic overlook to get engaged again I knew he was in trouble. I said ""OH I WROTE THIS MOVIE, She's going to push him off. "" We had a good chuckle.Had to shut it off. With all of the great programming out, no point in wasting a Sunday Night that.I came here to review and was hoping for a good SPOILER REVIEW to let me know what happened at the end. ALIENS? Shark Attack? In the Pacific Northwest? Definitely did not expect or see that coming.Maybe I have to go back and watch the last 5 minutes."
1055,Significant Other,10," Really it's between 6.8-7.3:This was a crazy movie and the special effects and imagination deserve a lot of credit. It caught me by surprise multiple times and went in direction I couldn't even dream of. This movie is unique and funky and disheveled and glib and spotty and cool and fun...go on the ride. I can imagine some people don't actually watch the whole thing or they are a acting snobs...the relationship is believable, it really is cause I've been in one with this level of connection. And they're both good actors...especially her...the cave scene made me jump crazy and the fact that it was deeper than I imagined made this one a total trip!"
1056,Moonfall,2," If you take parts of 20 other movies and mash them together:I'm a sci-fi junkie and I can enjoy a stupid, mindless action flick. I still find Armageddon highly entertaining to this day. I'm the kind of person who loves these kinds of movies. Except when they're complete trash like this one.This movie is terrible and has almost no redeeming qualities. The only thing I mildly enjoyed was some cool-looking scenes of destruction. Even the space stuff, which is normally an automatic plus for me, added nothing. Maybe it's missing the feel of space that good directors like Christopher Nolan are able to capture. Or maybe it's because I didn't care about the story or the characters even a tiny bit.Speaking of characters... what characters? They're all cardboard cutouts. You have zero investment in any of them. They spew lines of atrocious dialogue that sound like they were written by a computer program.While watching this, I kept noticing different things copied from various movies. This is fine if the movie is well-made, or if the copying is just for a portion of the movie. But this movie is poorly-made, and the copying seems to make up the entire thing.And while each of the movies it stole from likely delved deep into that concept, this movie just throws it in there as an afterthought. There are so many useless side plots. These are things that could have worked if they narrowed it down and focused on a couple.This movie is really dumb. I kept trying to forgive the flaws and give it a chance, but less than halfway through I started laughing at the stupidity. I had to make sure I didn't laugh too loud in case someone was enjoying it somehow.Seriously, I can't emphasize how dumb this movie is. Throughout. And I don't just mean the science and lack of believability, I can get past that. But very simple things like, for example, when a character tells another, ""You're the only one who believed me."" And I think to myself, ""Wait... WHAT??? He didn't believe you and had security escort you off the premises."" The movie is jam-packed with this type of nonsense.In the end, if you can't, at the very least, deliver entertaining mayhem, then you have failed. (1 viewing, opening night 2/3/2022)"
1057,Moonfall,3," Hilariously bad  and kinda fun because of it:It's been quite some time since I've seen a cast full of talented, well-regarded actors all give performances that are this terrible. To be fair, given this dialogue, I don't think any actor could have pulled off a good performance.This screenplay was written by guys who have never talked to another human being before. Every line of dialogue is contrived and laughably on the nose, with exposition delivered in a way that sometimes makes Marvel's Eternals feel like a masterclass of writing.The story has enough logical holes to fit the moon through. Convenience piles on top of convenience to make catastrophe possible, and then to help the characters survive the catastrophe. It's a script that can't withstand even the slightest amount of logical thought.Moonfall makes just as little sense as 2012, and the characters are just as dull. But, in a way, this film is the more disappointing one because of how much better it could have been.The character introductions and the setup for the emotional conflicts that these characters are experiencing with each other are actually compelling and somewhat competent. But the writers do NOTHING with these conflicts once they're established. Nobody learns anything; nobody actually overcomes anything or changes at all.Not that a movie like this really needs masterful character development, but it at least needs something, ANYTHING to make us care and want these characters to succeed. But there's nothing.Not even the visual effects are particularly good; they're certainly not bad, but no improvements have been made since the 2009 release of 2012, which looked groundbreaking at the time.Still, I didn't hate watching this. I found myself mesmerised at how the filmmakers were literally dropping the ball every step of the way. If that sort of thing gives you enjoyment, then see this on the biggest screen that you can!"
1058,Moonfall,6," Moonfall:6/10 - with the visuals of a true space blockbuster, this B movie features nonsensical dialogue, many many charcaters that serve absolutely no purpose, and an absolutely insane third act...but nonetheless, it's fun."
1059,Moonfall,7," I believe everybody doing this film was having an insane amount of fun (and possibly drugs):Roland Emmerich likes to have fun and blow up large stuff. With Moonfall, he blows up the Moon itself! Well, sort of. If you want this film to make sense, to show artistic qualities or make you ponder important questions about the nature and origin of humanity, you're in the wrong place. Instead, you have to imagine Emmerich as a little child who was given toys and who creates a completely bogus story that uses all of them together to maximum entertainment effect. That is it. You either laugh your behind off and enjoy the show or this movie is not for you."
1060,Moonfall,1," Trashfall:Another Emmerich mess. A Big budget wasted in a sloppy execution and a handful of stars acting by paycheck won't save a hollow script. I wonder how many professional or talented amateur writers found their work denied and how on Earth (or Moon if you like) scripts like this are produced. Rubbish! And I'm not insulting anyone, I'm just judging what I saw."
1061,Moonfall,1," Absolutely an abomination:1 star dialogue. ""you do know how to start a car right?"" she says. And he replies, ""I should warn you, I had my license revoked."" Smirk.Lets have a mission launch date and time, and then tell everyone to go home before it kicks off. Then find a solution 3 minutes later and everyone is disappeared and not available.A bad mix of 2012, Armageddon, The Core and other b rated films. Then make it worse. Talk about the wrong stuff. This is just terrible in all aspects.More great dialogue. ""You can't be serious."" ""We didn't come this far to fail.""
""There's gotta be another way.""
""God help us all.""The ending has to be rated on a 50 scale, as in 3/50. Seriously that bad.No wonder this director only gets to make a film every 5-8 years. Only 8 in 26yrs. And he happened to have something decent with Stargate and got a spinoff. Next movie out in 2030, I'll pass."
1062,Moonfall,5," I guess I like these kinds of movies  even though they're silly.:I don't think it's a bad movie. The effects were great. The movie üas just too long, longer than necessary. The subject of the movie is, of course, very, very, very ridiculous, but so are many movies too. I enjoyed watching the movie with my snacks and beer. I guess I like these kinds of movies, even though they're silly."
1063,Moonfall,5," Roland keeps Rolanding:In 2011, astronaut Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) is able to save a space shuttle mission from an alien swarm. Back on earth, he is betrayed by fellow astronaut Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry) and gets blamed for human error. It's ten years later. Brian is a shell of himself. Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon's orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.Director Roland Emmerich has woven a conspiracy theory into his brand of action sci-fi thriller. I like the potential. I even like the outlandish concept. The first half is a little clunky but I'm willing to go with it. The problematic writing does build up over time. It's his never-ending close calls and melodramas. It's the awkward sci-fi. The second half stumbles here and there until it falls flat. Roland is no longer that guy anymore. He's not making the big budget action thriller hits."
1064,Moonfall,3," Please take the camera away from Roland Emmerich...:Or give him a screenwriter. This is absolutely the biggest piece of trash yet. Extremely poor writing filled with cliches, trite comments, expected plots and the comic second banana. And the plot???? Gawd!!!!! The moon is hollow???? I spent part of the time. They've resusitated the characters for 2012 and INDEPENDENCE DAY and given them a new plot twist. It was so bad, I almost left halfway thru, (and I got in for free), but I decided to stay because I wanted to match the currect characters with those in the other films. Wait til it shows up on tv in 4 weeks and then for $5.99 groan with the friends and family. This is a stinker - 3 stars is generous!"
1065,Moonfall,2," Just when you thought Fast 9 is the most ridiculous movie ever made...:Watching the trailer, I stuck with Zendaya's MJ's rule; 'Expect disappointment so that you can never really be disappointed.' Except that this was beyond worse than what we had imagined.I like the idea of the film, that the moon is a threat to humanity. It's different but that's the only excellent thing to say about it. Other than that, it's a threat to our IQ.The biggest fault with Moonfall is that it fails to project the most basic principle to making a good disaster film which is creating a sense of fear for the audience. It almost doesn't have any, resulting in a boring entry. I did not get scared or restless, it didn't connect with me on a deeper level and it certainly doesn't have a good story to keep us at the edge of our seat hence, I couldn't care less if anyone dies. I didn't have the urgency to follow all the important people trying to put a stop from the catastrophic event because they throw all stakes out the window just like the Fast & Furious franchise. The main characters are ordinary people built extraordinarily strong.Adding the grim fact that Moonfall includes aliens composed of A. I and technology while also trying to relate to the audience by making it realistic, it falls down to the bottom of the abyss quickly. It doesn't work like other alien-based films like Prometheus or War of the Worlds did where they succeed in creating fear, showing people panicking while sucking us inside the experience.Yes, we are supposed to surrender from the sheer silliness of it but how can we when we are made to believe that its law of physics and world principles should follow ours and they broke every threshold to the point that we feel like this is a spin-off of the Transformers franchise.This marketed end-of-the-world disaster flick film is extremely ridiculous, even if you suspend your disbelief, you would never get your head around the plot. Not because you're dumb, but because the movie is, and I mean REALLY, REALLY dumb. It's like it's been written by Roland Emmerich's son and his dad helped him by putting scientific jargons to make it believable. Only if it did. 😩 And here I thought Independence Day 2: Resurgence was a trash, Moonfall is a shame to humanity's existence.Usually the end of the world presents seas of people running away, but Moonfall doesn't. It's a blockbuster movie about apocalypse and yet, it feels small at times. There even isn't that many shots that 'wow' us with horrific sceneries or powerful images like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow. Even the CGI isn't all that good especially when a person is talking mid-shot and the CGI looks awful in the background.Now don't get me started with the cheap comedy. I'm confused whether it's intended to make us annoyed or laugh cause I didn't laugh one bit and neither did the audience I was with.I know loving or hating a film is fully entitled to a person's taste and opinion but this movie is so bad, I dare to say this; if you like the film, you are an immature person and you have a bad taste.Okay, maybe some of you are asking me to calm down as you're reading this but imagine the hundreds or thousands of scripts just stacking there in the room, unread because it's written by a nobody or it's got some minor English errors. And they chose this to be greenlit amongst those??? It saddens me that the political game of the Hollywood industry has come to this. Emmerich was a great director but his ideas have now diluted less and less.Verdict: Just when you thought Fast 9 is the most ridiculous film ever made, Moonfall steals the baton happily from its opponent. By far, the worst film of 2022."
1066,Moonfall,1," A Kaspersky and Lexus Ad with the scientific depth of sharknado:Do you know those movies that are so bad, they are good? This isn't one of them. This is just bad.But nothing beats. The Kaspersky logo on an Endeavour shuttle screen saying it is protecting the system.I'll give you a moment for that to sink in: an US space shuttle and flew from 1992 to 2011 has an internal system that not only runs Windows, but for some reason runs not only an antivirus, but one made by a Russian company.At least Catwoman is no longer the worse movie Halle Barry was in."
1067,Moonfall,2," I cannot describe how bizarre and bad this film is:I really can't express how much I hated this film. I went in with my brain turned off, expecting a dumb fun disaster film with some crazy fun set pieces. Instead the first hour was a dour slog with uninteresting characters, while the second half was utterly insane (in a bad way).The film's premise is simple. The moon is falling, can Earth surivive? But instead the film decides is going to try to offer a cerebral and complex backstory to the moon for some reason. In a 10 minute exposition dumb, Patrick Wilson learns that humans actually originated from a halo ring, but then ai rose up and took over nanoparticles to kill humans, so the humans made 1000 moons and flew them to different parts of the galaxy??? What?This plot twist is so dumb, immediatley after it happens, Wilson has to re-explain what he just learned to the other characters (and the audience who is clearly baffled).Meanwhile, there's a super dull survival plot on Earth with characters you don't care about. There's one mildly entertaining car chase which lasts 2 minutes tops.I can't describe how bad this film is. The only thing I liked were the cool cgi shots of the moon plummeting to earth and the asteroids.AVOID."
1068,Moonfall,5," Big Bang Style:If you watch a disaster movie made by Roland Emmerich you get what you expect: big explosions, fine work by the special departments and a rather simple story with forgettable characters. Moonfall is no exception - get your coke and pop-corn, lay back and enjoy the show. But in the case you don't like that kind of big screen disaster movies, don't bother."
1069,Moonfall,4," Ranks among the stupidest  most ridiculous movies to come from a director like this  and that's saying something:""Moonfall"" is a sci-fi disaster film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""2012""). Starring Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley, it ranks among the stupidest, most ridiculous movies to come from a director like this, and that's saying something.After a mysterious force knocks the Moon out of orbit, conspiracy theorist K. C. Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that it is due to collide with the Earth in a matter of weeks. The news soon gets through to former astronaut turned NASA executive Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry) who comes up with a plan to save all of humanity from impending disaster. With time quickly running out, Fowler teams up with Houseman and her old astronaut colleague Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) on a mission into outer space to prevent the Moon from wiping out everyone and everything they love.Aside from perhaps the first ""Independence Day"" and ""The Patriot"", I've never been a fan of Roland Emmerich's work. Like Michael Bay, I think his films are too reliant on mindless explosions and destructive forces rather than meaningful stories and properly developed characters. However, it seems there are a select few people out there who actually enjoy these types of movies as they provide simple popcorn entertainment that doesn't require too much thought process. While I can understand the need to turn one's brain off every now and then to unwind, there's only so much implausibility I can handle before it starts to get on my nerves. ""Moonfall"" is another example of what Emmerich's movies are capable of, and that is overcompensating for a lack of intelligent storytelling with as much CGI-filled destruction as possible.What surprised me the most was that in spite of its ridiculously silly plot, the film never once had me invested in anything that was happening. Usually the cheesiest of films have at least one thing that can hold my interest but as I was watching I could never find anything remotely worthwhile following. It was at that point I realised what was wrong - I had already seen everything in this film years ago. The complete lack of imagination in the film's screenplay had it ripping off other Roland Emmerich films like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" with abnormal weather ploughing through cities and ""2012"" with huge tsunamis tossing cargo ships into buildings. Even with my disbelief suspended to the maximum, I still couldn't get past how shamelessly derivative and lazy the film was in rehashing every disaster movie cliché we've seen in the past 30 years.Oftentimes I am willing to forgive a film's implausible story if there is a certain amusement factor to balance things out. The problem with this film is that I struggled to find anything fun or entertaining that's worth mentioning. Frequently I found myself rolling my eyes at how just many plotholes, inconsistencies, and convenient coincidences there were riddled throughout the film. Additionally, there's no feeling of suspense or tension whenever a character is placed in a dangerous situation. For example, during a lengthy car chase I didn't feel any excitement because I could immediately the main characters would survive merely because the plot demands it. Moments like this take me out of the movie since I can only sever my disbelief for so long before I tune out altogether. Because of this, within the first half hour, I was already bored out of my mind.As for the CGI effects, they are mediocre at best. Sure, there are some decent shots of the Moon drifting closer towards the Earth that give off a sense of peril, but everything else looked incredibly unconvincing. For example, during the previously mentioned car chase scene, each of the cars looked so fake that it felt as though I were watching a cutscene from a PlayStation 2 game. This may have looked alright 30 years ago but this is coming from a film released in 2022. Perhaps I have simply become desensitised to all the much better looking CGI in films made by people who know what they are doing whereas almost everything in this one seemed unusually amateurish.Very few people remember the cast members in a Roland Emmerich film and there's a good reason for that - they are written so one dimensionally that they never have a chance to leave an impression on the viewer. Halle Berry always seemed so distant from her character. She never once had me believe that she was the type of person who had crawled her way up the corporate ladder at NASA to become its Deputy Director. It's a shame because I think she is an otherwise talented actress who has unfortunately made a number of poor choices in picking roles since she won an Oscar. I assume she only did this film for the paycheck so hopefully she made some decent money from this experience.Patrick Wilson tries to chew the scenery as a disgraced former astronaut, but I never once felt any sympathy towards him because his character is so bland and unlikeable. In the beginning they attempt to set him up as a fallen hero seeking redemption but most of the time he keeps digging himself deeper into despair. This man is intended to be someone the audience should care about so it makes no sense for film to constantly show the negative aspects of his character to the point where you pity him rather than feel any admiration. There's only so much self-destructive behaviour you can show someone inflicting on themselves before you lose respect for them and start to think that maybe they've earned their place at rock bottom.The only character that comes close to having some dimension was K. C. Houseman, played by John Bradley. Although he is essentially a stock conspiracy theorist who turns out to be right in the end, Bradley at least looks like he's having some fun with the role. Maybe it's because he's the only one of the three main characters whom the audience can sort of relate to simply because he seems more like an actual person than the others. With that said, he's still very similar to other conspiracy-focused characters in previous Roland Emmerich films like Woody Harrelson in ""2012"" and Randy Quaid in ""Independence Day"", which again brings to mind how cookie cutter all these films truly are.If I haven't made it clear by now, ""Moonfall"" is nothing more than another film to throw on the pile of Roland Emmerich disaster flicks that serves no other purpose than to show off as much mindless destruction and chaos as possible. It may not be as bad as ""10,000 BC"", but it's sure up there with the worst of his films. Then again, some people flock to Emmerich's movies for this very reason so I suppose it should fill that void for those craving their fix. As for others who may be forced to sit through it, you might as well play what I like to call ""Disaster Movie Bingo"" to pass some time until the credits. In fact, I'll even help you get started: Major landmarks destroyed? Check. Implausible science? Check. Nonsensical plot devices? Check. Forgettable supporting characters? Check. Incompetent Military? Bingo!I rate it 3.5/10."
1070,Moonfall,6," Independence Moonmargeddon:Emmerich - who you gonna hire when it comes to a movie of this kind and calibre? I mean one is almost tempted to say that he is doing one thing in different forms/movies. There are elements from so many other movies here. Be it in the characters or the themes of the movie. The important question though is: can you suspend your disbelief? And I don't mean just a little! I am talking about all the way here.And if you've done that, all the cliches come out and they will make you cringe. The characters feel like they have a story put upon them. You'll either find certain things gullible or plain offensive to your taste buds. The special effects are top notch, the dialog not so much. Many moments that feel ... lame quite frankly. The whole patriotism thing is to be expected - but that doesn't make it any better either. Michael Pena feels underused - I don't hate him - which may be just enough I reckon (pun intended).Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry are the ones that save the day (no pun intended). John Bradley may be the wild card - but he also is hit and miss. His character that is, he is trying his best I'd say. Just never critisize the conspiracy guy from Godzilla versus Kong ever again, if you actually love this character right here.Nothing more to say here other than it is quite rich, that Emmerich critisizes Star Wars and the MCU when he is unable to make a coherent Blockbuster of his own, that at times make Fast and Furious look like it's legit and realistic ... I know, right? But as you can see in my rating, I didn't mind too much ... or rather I'm being ""kind"" again - something I have been accused of a lot anyway."
1071,Moonfall,7," No brainer sci-fi popcorn shizzle.:So if you want to enjoy this movie ,disable your brain for a few hours,and let it all happen.If you do that,you might have a good 2 hours,like I did.Yes it's popcorn Sci-fi ,and sometimes it's good to watch movies like this. Special fx are awesome and it is spectacular. No ,it will never get Oscar for acting or original script or whatever. That's a deep - in this movie.But,..hey! I had fun. My score 6.7."

I kid you not. And don't forget to turn your brain off.""Moonfall"" is a latest disaster sci=fi movie from Roland Emmerich and if you have seen any of his movies before, you know what you will get here. I got exactly what i wanted to - a mindless yet actually solidly made nonsense that was well paced and directed - at running time 2 h i wasn't bored and as a huge science fiction fan i was mindlessly entertained. Special effects were pretty good as well as the overall experience.Overall, ""Moonfall"" is the ultimate guilty pleasure. Its a movie were you have turn the logic of and just enjoy the ride. If enjoyed at least some of the previous movie of Roland Emmerich then ""Moonfall"" might actually be pretty nice escapism for a boring evening."
1073,Moonfall,1," Anti science / NASA hit piece?:This movie was terrible to watch. I know it's Sci fi, but that doesn't mean the film or actors shouldn't be grounded in reality. Suspension of disbelief can only take the audience so far."
1074,Moonfall,5," Arthur C. Clarke worthy idea  ""Troll 2"" worthy writing and directing:Being a Millennial, I can attest to our generation that it was a great time to be alive with ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"" being some of our favorite tween-age blow-up-knock-down action movies to go see with our friends in the theater 3 times in the same day, with campy yet lovable characters like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Those were the days. I still enjoy watching those flicks from time to time - not just for the nostalgia. They are still quite entertaining in their own right.Now we have ""Moonfall"" some 25 years later. Cut from the same construction paper, but more like pieces of old scripts from Roland Emmerich's late '90s writing room shredder taped together in hopes the characters and dialog would be usable in telling the grandiose destructo-type story instead of just talking props. Speaking of which, I give props to Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley (who actually had a solid character to go with his style) for trying, but it simply wasn't enough.I've listened to commentaries and interviews with Emmerich and I personally think he doesn't have good instincts on how to put a balanced action film together since the mid 2000s (with the ID4 sequel, if you watch the deleted scenes cut what would've been the best and most meaningful scenes of the entire movie) with the aim of just going big and loud, using any means whatsoever. It works...until it doesn't. Action fatigue sets in frequently in this and many of his recent past movies. It's alarming when I am physically incapable of caring less about the world ending than watching these characters attempt to get from beginning to end - in fact, there was no palpable peril despite the entire earth getting properly f'ed up, we only see it in overhead shots of floods and earthquakes and meteorites (I think COVID may have had something to do with not being able to have scenes with dozens of extras on the ground clamoring over each other like in all other action flicks from the days of yore).However, the concept was intriguing and in my opinion, pretty great. It reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" but with the Moon instead of a floating cylinder in space. I really did enjoy watching the last 20-30 mins or so play out after an hour and a half of random skipping around characters trying to hatch the plan to get us to that point while trying to make the audience like and/or care. If the script had half the heart and good campiness of something like ""Independence Day"", it definitely could have kicked my rating up a little.Wait for streaming."
1075,Moonfall,4," Catwoman  Ed Warren and Samwell Tarley save the world in this preposterous blockbuster:It may seem far too early in the year to be claiming such things but it's going to take something truly special (seriously random) for my personal favorite final scene of the year to be anything but Moonfall's need to be seen effort.Without dwelling on that for any longer or entering in spoiler territory overload, it's onto the important matter at hand of exploring Roland Emmerich's latest city/landmark destroying blockbuster.To describe Moonfall as ludicrous, preposterous and utterly bonkers would be underselling just how out there Emmerich's big, dumb and even sometimes fun new film is, as while you may be expecting a typical astronauts and the government save the world from a hurtling towards the Earth Moon type of film, Moonfall goes to many an unexpected place that must surely make it a genuine contender for what will be one of 2022's most bizarre blockbusters.A director who has well and truly given up being anything his not, Emmerich's latest effort is very much cut from the same cloth as his most renowned blockbusters such as Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 and for anyone expecting any type of nuance to be present in Moonfall you're heading for a rude shock, as the films daft script, B-grade worthy performances and pointless/ridiculous plot points and characters litter almost every scene of the films two hour plus runtime.Thankfully it appears as though Emmerich and his cast that includes the paycheck collecting duo of Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson as NASA employees Jocinda Fowl and Brian Harper, Game of Thrones John Bradley as wannabe doctor and mathematician wizz KC Houseman and a few why even bother appearances from Michael Pena and Donald Sutherland all were on the same page with Moonfall's insane premise, meaning that there is fun to be had from watching Catwoman, Ed Warren and Samwell Tarley head to the moon to save humankind, especially as the films unexpected late acts take hold.If you as a viewer fail to get on the same wavelength as the film from the early stages its likely Emmerich's unrefined, loud and CGI infested event will quickly become a film that is hard too sit through, as there's little reason to recommend this film in such a content heavy time for films of all shapes and sizes but there's an argument to be made that these type of daft but knowingly so films have a time and place in our marketplace, despite there being no reason for it to exist outside of mindless entertainment.Final Say -One of Roland Emmerich's most out there carnage-filled blockbusters yet full of cringe and head scratching moments, Moonfall is even more crazy than one might've expected but provides the exact type of experience one would expect from a filmmaker that has long since passed the time where he tried to be anything that his not.2 Fuzz Aldrin's out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
1076,Moonfall,1," This is an atrocious movie even for Roland Emmerich!:This film is feels like a parody of other Roland Emmerich. It honestly feels like Roland Emmerich saw F9 (2021) & he made this film just to say, You people think that F9 was a stupid film, you thought that was stupid crap, well guess what I'm going to make something even more stupid."" This was 2-hours of stupidity that I chose to fast forward a lo t of the film just to shorter my suffering. Overall, Moonfall (2022) is an abysmal film & it's easily Roland Emmerich's 2nd worst film behind Godzilla (1998)."
1077,Moonfall,2," More like Moonfail:Entertaining plot concept but either far too serious and too slow with not enough crazy or exciting moments or far too preposterous to be taken seriously. The special effects are sometimes spectacular but nothing new, the plot has major issues and the pacing is awful as it jumps back and forth between the different groups. The leads are ok, but the supporting character are poorly written and acted and the few jokes weren't funny."
1078,Moonfall,1, Garbage:Worst movie I've seen in so many years. Horrible acting and horrible screen play. This movie was rushed and ridiculous. Please don't waste your time. There is a ridiculous scene involving an oxygen tank. You'll see. Insult to our intelligence.
1079,Moonfall,1, Don't Waste Your Time or Money. Simply AWFUL:Cannot be a worse movie out right now. I tried three times to watch and finish the film. Couldn't do it. I BOUGHT this movie to see it early. HUGE lapse in judgement on my part. It's simply unbearably bad. Not bad like the 1960s classic sci-fi films that were bad in a funny way. Just plain bad bad. 😑👎👎💣
1080,Moonfall,1," Howl at the Moon...:Absolutely nothing about this film's fine, cast and crew are stuffed full of moonshine, with a dialogue for loons (or lunes), a dead cert for lampoons, what a celestially cinematic waste of time.We all know the moon's made of cheese!"
1081,The Prestige,10," Just As Intriguing The Second Time  Too!:I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"
1082,The Prestige,10," Fantastic.:I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+""."
1083,The Prestige,10," Are you watching closely?:The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet ""The Great Danton"" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name ""The Professor"" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of ""The Transported Man"" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of ""The Transported Man"", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: ""Are you watching closely?"" A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10"
1084,The Prestige,10," A Nutshell Review: The Prestige:I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?"
1085,The Prestige,9," Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission:I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."
1086,The Prestige,10," A Film with Intellect:I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece."
1087,The Prestige,10," Give This Film Time to Sink In...:Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"". But if you see two, ""The Prestige"" better be on your list."
1088,The Prestige,9," Webby meshwork of magic and mystery:Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10"
1089,The Prestige,8," So glad this movie did not stay an illusion...:In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"".The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long ""The Prestige"". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie."
1090,The Prestige,8," Storytelling at its best!:The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across."
1091,The Prestige,9," Obsession and Revenge:Around the turn of the century, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to the magician Cutter (Michael Caine). Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.In a way, the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much. The movie may be better to be more straight forward. Personally, I like the challenge."
1092,The Prestige,8," A Stylish  Uniquely Twisted Period Piece:What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision."
1093,The Prestige,10," Borden (Tesla) vs Angier (Edison):Great movie with Great actors writers and twists.Something that i didn't see anybody said about it that rivalry between two magicians is reference to Tesla and Edison's rivalry.
In the beginning they worked together, then became opponents. I think Borden is Tesla cause he always was more talented than Angier (Edison) who stole Borden's idea.Surely on of the best movies in this century, be sure to watch it more than one time."
1094,The Prestige,9," The Prestige:Great movie and best movie I've seen directed by Christopher Nolan. The story of the movie was great and I did not expect the end. Most of the film's characters were excellent, and Tesla's appearance in the film was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale who were dazzling in the film, the film embodies the period of the end of the nineteenth century, a great film."
1095,The Prestige,, One of the best movies EVER:What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist. A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie. This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.
1096,The Prestige,," fascinating:a film about magic at different levels. the magic as art. the magic as axis of life. art as only way to survive. beautiful, mysterious, ambiguous and almost impeccable. in fact, brilliant job. and this status is result of delicate-precise mixture of acting, impeccable story, splendid atmosphere and the feeling than competition escapes from the screen. a seductive detail - David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a role who gives to film a special flavor. at first sigh, story of a cruel fight for success. or a portrait of manipulation art. in fact, fresco of a time. and one of admirable roles for Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman."
1097,The Prestige,10," my notes:Omg. possibly the greatest film ever made. the most genius story ever put to film. I keep saying it's hard for me to believe that it's even possible to come up with such a smart story. Amazing acting throughout. Intense throughout. Seems to get better with each viewing (5 viewings)
SPOILERS
after watching this for a 5th time, i still picked up on things that i don't think i noticed before, which is so impressive of this movie. the biggest one was that i could tell which brother was being portrayed by bale. the one that got married was nicer and calmer and more comforting. the one that sexes scarlett josexy is meaner, short-tempered and cockier. the fact that i could tell who was who, based on very subtle differences in his acting style, he's the GOAT for a reason. bale is a master of his craft."
1098,The Prestige,8," Batman and Alfred (outside Gotham) meet Wolverine:In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson)."
1099,The Prestige,9," A Great Tale of Rivalry  Obsession  Revenge and Sacrifice:In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")"
1100,The Prestige,8," ""It is very rare to see... real magic."":Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion."
1101,The Prestige,8," Imaginative and intriguing crash of wits between two famous magicians:This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among magicians is set in turn-of-the last century, London.Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) his wife Julie McCullough(Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden(admirable Christian Bale) are friends and magician's assistants. Then Julie accidentally deceases during a sideshow , Robert accuses Alfred for her killing . A new assistant named Olivia(Scarlett Johansson) helps Robert and he falls in love with her, though later she fell in love with another man. The magicians use their powers to combat among them. Both become prestigious magicians and get mutual envy. Magician Robert sees the Borden's transportation show and he becomes obsessed with his magic trick. They battle each other for their magic tricks and Robert attempts disclose the secret about disappearance from his contender with fateful results.This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres: the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era, mystery thriller and fantasy.The picture gets it all : suspense, mystery drama, star crossed lovers,plot twists, murders,tragedy and supernatural illusions . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Jackman, Bale, Johansson as eclectic secondaries, Caine,David Bowie,Andie Serkis and Rebecca Hall.Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Wally Pfister. Intriguing and evocative musical score by David Julyan. The motion picture is perfectly directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia,Memento,Batman begins, Dark night¨. At the same time was made another film(2006)with similar theme titled 'The illusionist'by Neal Burger with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel which also achieved much success. Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think. The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work,it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final."
1102,The Prestige,10," Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...:... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film."
1103,The Prestige,10," (Magic) Layers:I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!"
1104,The Prestige,8, Fantastic!:The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.
1105,The Prestige,10," This movie fills the screen and your mind.:I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one, you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you, what is one willing to sacrifice for the ""prestige?""I think this one's an Oscar definite."
1106,Alien,10," Holds up as a classic.:Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10"
1107,Alien,10," A Timeless Science Fiction Masterpiece:'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

1108,Alien,10," One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece:A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about ""extraterrestrial life form"" it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite (the facehugger) was excellent designed and brilliant. Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters: Parker, Brett, Lambert, Ripley, Ash, Captain Dallas, Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film (because it is my favorite film), The Thing, Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but ""Alien"" is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 10/10 doesn't deserve the hate."
1109,Alien,9," The facehugger scared me as a kid and i still find em creepy.:Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n as a kid i found it to be a bit slow but was shaken by the chestburster scene.The facehugger terrified me as a kid.Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.Revisited this part again few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.I feel that this part is inspired by Bava's Planet of the Vampires.The ruins with the skeletal remains, the design and shots of the ship itself does have the deja vu effect.This one is atmospheric n dark, gory at times, it has enuff stuff for sci fi fans, it also has slasher n war like tone.But the best thing is the feminist tone where in this part the women are not being cast as the helpless victims."
1110,Alien,10," The Purina Dog Chow company will expand and make a big mistake!:Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)"
1111,Alien,," Classic horror:The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level."
1112,Alien,," A horror classic that has stood the test of time! Still by far the best movie in the series.:'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!"
1113,Alien,9," Prophetic & Visionary...:Allegorically and quite unintentionally a tale of a virus, ignorantly released its only aim is to destroy us, the wheels set in motion, a search begins for a new potion, but perpetuation has begun and there's absolutely nowhere you can run - from the evolutionary transformations, variations and mutations, the prequels, sequels and unequals yet to come."
1114,Alien,10," Classic tale of terror:This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"
1115,Alien,," My favourite tagline for a movie:""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film."
1116,Alien,10," Iconographic Horror:ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android ""revival"" are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
1117,Alien,10," Undeniably stunning:This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy."
1118,Alien,10," A new appreciation of this film's excellence:Seven members of a space mining cargo ship who are headed back to Earth are awakened from hypersleep when their ship detects a signal from an intelligent civilization on a small, uncharted planet. When they locate the source of the signal, they find more than they bargained for, and all of their lives are endangered.My feelings about this first film in the Alien series have vacillated slightly over the years. I loved it when I first saw it as a young teenager in the theater back in 1979. Later, I wasn't as enamored with it, and had actually rated it as low as a 7 out of 10--at one point believing it to be my least favorite of the series. Now, however, my appreciation of the film has matured a bit, and I'm back to thinking it's a solid 10 out of 10.The film's strong points are rooted in director Ridley Scott's focused commitment to sustaining a desolate, dark atmosphere and gradually building suspense over the course of the film. Alien is unusual for its era in its pacing, its lack of comic relief, and its refusal to provide breaks from its growing tension. All three of these facts make it a somewhat ""difficult film"". It's not recommended for light viewing. It's not a ""popcorn film"". You have to be in the mood to sit down, slow down, concentrate, invest emotion, and let yourself be enveloped in the film's world.With Alien, Scott has created a kind of bleak tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is evident in many characteristics of the film, such as the graceful slowness of the cinematography, editing and much of the action in the first section of the film, including sustained pans across sterile-looking environments and wide external shots of (a) hulking but elegant spacecraft, the personification of the ship's computer, known as ""Mother"" here rather than Hal, a few subtle instances of classical music, the surprise discovery of a monumental structure on another celestial body, and so on. However, there are no instances of pleasant psychedelia here, no retreats into dreamworlds, no messages of hope, no benevolence from alien beings. Alien is strictly concerned with making its sci-fi an issue of classic horror. At a base level, it is about a malevolent monster, first encountered in a dark, Gothic environment and later chasing our heroes through a cross between a haunted house and crypt-like labyrinths.Much has been said about visual artist H.R. Giger's alien and production design, and the film wouldn't be nearly as successful without it. Giger is largely responsible for the look of the beacon ship on the small planet, both its exterior and interior, the cocoon later encountered on the cargo ship, and the creatures. His work also inspired a lot of smaller elements, as can be seen in doorways, pipes, and other features of the cargo ship. Like most of his work, these features are a combination of metallic and organic, mechanical and biological, futuristic and Gothic. They complement the austere Kubrickian sensibility in a surprising but completely successful way.Scott also uses simple effects like steam, as well as unique lighting and sound effects to help build the film's thick tension. These techniques gradually become more conspicuous as the film goes on, finally culminating in a claustrophobic symphony of flashing lights, constantly hissing pipes and hoses, and an incessant audio alarm.Finally, the last key to the excellence of the film is the cast. Although a somewhat stereotypical movie-world ragtag bunch, their characterizations provide more depth than the norm, with Sigourney Weaver as the standout, in perhaps the defining role of her career, and one of the more admirable filmic portrayals of a woman--she's the smartest, most sensible, strongest, and certainly most sexy of the bunch."
1119,Alien,9, The start of a great anthology:Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.
1120,Alien,9," ""Alien"" is not just the monster  it's the atmosphere and the way you feel!:In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains. All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
1121,Alien,10," Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place?:I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say, given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo, a merchant vessel carrying, if I remember correctly, something like 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore, there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate, I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter, because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. That being said, I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail, which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films. No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody, gory death scenes, the alien, masterfully designed, isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design, we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie. Like Jaws, Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation. The Nostromo is a merchant ship, which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand. The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds, and so it wakes up the crew to investigate. The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear, the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule, because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members, it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated, they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship, complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside, creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs, gets attacked, and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly, protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite, a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse, the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable, worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship, and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been (and possibly ever will be) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel, Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for, the darker, more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact, by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now, you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then, this was horror/science fiction. Today, it's science fiction/horror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today, it is significant that, while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror, the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it, it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right."
1122,Alien,10," The mother of all movies:Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING: 10"

After searching for survivors, the ill-fated crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them . The merciless alien lives on human flesh and continually changes form . Then the Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous being that is running amok . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s and 80s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creature by the artist HR Giger , it was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid . Extraordinary as well as astounding special effects in the chestburster scenes , the rumor that the cast, except for John Hurt, did not know what would happen during scenes is partly true and it was filmed in one take with four cameras; for instance, Veronica Cartwright did not expect to be sprayed with blood. The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien . ¨Alien¨ is clearly inspired by ¨It ¡ the terror from beyond space¨ . Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship such as Tom Skerritt who is awesome in compelling lead role as commandant , Harry Dean Stanton , Veronica Cartwright , Yaphet Kotto , John Hurt and special mention to Ian Holm . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Ridley Scott who keeps everything bouncing at an absolutely frantic pace . Ridley Scott cites three films as the shaping influences on his movie: George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) for their depiction of outer space, and Tobe Hooper's Texas chain saw massacre (1974) for its treatment of horror .It is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance ; ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet with Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott .

1124,Alien,10," Alien.....the one that started it all........:Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about...."
1125,Alien,10," After 40 years it still scares the hell out of me:When I see reviewers ratings less than five I have shake my head in disbelief. Alien set a standard that has yet to be equaled let alone surpassed. I watched it on the wide screen when it was first released, and over a dozen times since. And even though I know what's coming, the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up. What a brilliant work of theatrical genius."
1126,Alien,10," This Ageless  Silent  Haunted House Floating in Silent Space:Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the ""haunted house"" and merged it in a seamless sieve with ""body horror"" and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.The story had been done before, in different genres, never veering too far from its horror origins. Lovecraft (and others) had written about expeditions that had gone to ""investigate"" and ""collect important data"" only to find themselves being hunted down one by one, be it an unseen terror or their own fears.Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However, it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large space-jockey with a thing attached to its face, dead, we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large, they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful, restrained, but a classic in the horror-movie sense: it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing age-old tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts -- one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nerve-wracking because again, fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates: ""I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger!"" All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable, twisted scene, his tail snaking up Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) leg. Later on, as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role), the quintessential Final Girl, makes her escape, it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking. What the alien is doing to her we can only imagine and recoil."
1127,Alien,10," Original and terrifying sci fi terror:Alien is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. This kicked off a mostly excellent franchise and influenced cinema as whole. Designed with great detail by brilliant artist HR Geiger the Alien brings forth a new level of intergalactic terror. Alien is completely different from anything that came before and took sci fi horror to new heights and gave it a lot of depth. The ensemble cast is excellent and is lead by Sigorney Weaver and had Yaphett Kotto, Tom Skerrit and Harry Dean Stanton as strong support. In my opinion this film is flawless and still looks incredible today. The special effects are amazing and the acting and direction is spot on. Alien is incredible and in my opinion is timeless. The film aged well and is essential and a classic."
1128,Alien,," Exemplary horror (spoilers):What makes Alien such an effective horror film is how quiet it is. After all, most horror films make the mistake of equating fear with noise. But that's often a mistake, as silence is usually infinitely more effective. And so it is with Alien. The scariest moments are all devoid of intrusive scoring, jagged editing and overblown sound effects. Instead most of the sound and music is pulled out and shots are held for a long time.One of the best examples is when Brett is killed. He has to chase after a cat and he's led into a dark corner of the ship. You know he's going to get killed but Ridley Scott knows that you know. Therefore the sequence is dragged out. All the time you're waiting. You're waiting for the inevitable. But Scott doesn't rush things. He racks up the tension by having Brett wander for an inordinate length of time and by having him wash his face in a shower of dripping water as chains rattle in the background. And when the Alien does appear, it's not with a sudden jolt. It just appears quietly behind Brett before killing him. And the way that the death is played on the face of the cat, which has a look of almost stunned curiosity, makes the whole sequence rather spooky. It's not really a crash, bang, wallop sort of horror film.Not that there aren't plenty of jump moments. There are actually quite a few. But because the lead-up is so quiet and ominous it makes the pay-off a whole more effective. For example, when Kane looks into the egg. Again the sequence takes its time, but when he finally has a peek and the facehugger leaps out, it has the perfect timing of a great joke.Another fantastic piece of timing is when the Alien takes Dallas. You go through another long, drawn out sequence of him scurrying through narrow air vents before the Alien finally pops out of a dark corner. But although the moment is fantastically timed, the lead up is where the fun lies. Although I do have to say that the lead up is probably the most frightening thing in the film. Dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying to take the Alien out, but you know it's futile. And the dark, claustrophobic corridors are full of iris-shaped doors that open and close slowly and forebodingly, which really does add to the air of dread that fills the sequence. And the tracker is the icing on the cake  it racks up the tension to an even greater extent.The second most frightening sequence is when Ripley is finally alone in the ship. She sets the Nostromo to self-destruct so that she can take the shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees the Alien. She then goes back and tries to reverse the self-destruct sequence, but it's too late. It's frightening because Ripley has to run around the ship, not knowing where the Alien might be. No longer does she have the option of just hiding. And with everyone dead she no longer has anyone to talk to or help her out. She's all alone. But perversely, once everyone's dead, the film finally gets loud. There's a countdown sequence (which is brilliant in the way that it adds tension) and the ship begins to destruct. Just when Ripley might have needed the silence to find out where the Alien is, she has to run around in cacophony of noise knowing that the Alien could be anywhere.But the silence comes back in the final sequence, and it's quite ingenious the way that the Alien is camouflaged in the shuttle. I nearly messed myself when I first saw it as a kid.What I also like about the final sequence is that it's weirdly sexual. Ripley strips down to her underwear and then the Alien appears. And the Alien then begins almost stroking the console it's resting on. And of course, Ripley penetrates the Alien a harpoon. Nice.Another excellent bit of weird sexuality is when Ash the robot tries to choke Ripley with a magazine. He shoves it her mouth and he looks rather turned on as she gags on it. Perhaps robots don't come with all the parts. Perhaps this is his way of venting his frustration. But there's also the way that the Alien kills Lambert. Its tail inches up the insides of her thigh and then you cut away and hear her screaming like she's being violated  the screaming is actually pretty damn chilling. And of course, Kane getting ripped open goes back to the male fear of childbirth. (The birth scene is still great. The blood, the sound and the way it takes the Alien two or three attempts to burst through is fantastic. But I do have to say that the way the Alien shoots off the table looks rather dodgy.) Going back to the Lambert killing, though As well as being chilling, this scene is also quite frustrating because Parker (Yaphet Kotto) gets killed as well. I mean, Parker is just The Man. I swear he could have taken the Alien had it not been for the cowardly Lambert. (It's quite surprising that the coward and the black character survive so long  they're usually the first two to go.) But although I dig Parker, I think Ian Holm as Ash delivers the best performance. It's quite subtle the way that he hints at his true identity  I like the way he jogs on the spot to get his joints working. And he's so smug and slimy. He's more of a villain than the Alien.But I think everything in the film is fantastic  the music, the special effects, the sequence on the alien planet, the production design, the moody atmosphere, the script I just wish I had more room to waffle."
1129,Alien,9," The original masterpiece that launched a dynasty:As the credits of ""Alien"" open, the slowly paced opening titles and soft, eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film.  It starts off so unassumingly that first-time viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half.  It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes ""Alien"" work so well, for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show.  This flip in drama, pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark sub-genre-sci-fi movies of the 20th century. The film is directed by Englishman Ridley Scott, who had a total of one feature and numerous commercials under his belt when he took control of proceedings.  Since the success of ""Alien"", Scott has had an uneven career with highlights like ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Gladiator"" and most recently ""Black Hawk Down"" and low points like ""Legend"", ""G.I. Jane"" and the bore-fest ""1492"".  ""Alien"" represents the overtly stylistic and slick approach Scott brings to his films, traits that are useful in science fiction but can sometimes seem out of place in more realistic genres. Here Scott retires the glitz and glamour of ""Star Wars"", which had been released two years before ""Alien"".  Instead he portrays the spacecraft and crew as nothing more than a cargo ship and a rag tag bunch of intergalactic truckers.  This works very well, as the viewer gets the distinct sense of the tedium and oppressive vastness of space travel.  The way the crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes the audience feel that yes, perhaps one day man will view space travel with a shrug. The opening scene shows us a huge spaceship, named the Nostromo, returning to earth with 20,000,000 tonnes of mineral ore on board.  The crew sleep in hibernation, until the onboard computer awakens them.  It seems the computer has picked up a possible distress signal on an alien planet.  Under the law of the nameless and faceless 'Company', the crew are obliged to investigate. The waking scene is superbly filmed.  Kane (John Hurt) slowly rises, like a chick from and egg.  Squinting and only partially awake, slow dissolves from one angle of Kane to another emphasise his delirium and partial consciousness.  The final dissolve dissipates to the mess hall.  Here we meet the entire crew of the Nostromo for the first time. The ship is led by Dallas (Tom Skerrit), with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as the first officer.  Ash (Ian Holm) is the odd, skittish science officer, Kane (John Hurt) is weathered but adventurous, Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the whiny and weak navigation officer, and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) are the engineering grunts.  The ship is controlled by Mother, a mute version of HAL 9000 from 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Like ""2001"", the reasons for having humans on board is unknown; they almost seem pointless as the ship can basically control itself.  Are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at the will of the computer? They respond to the distress signal after landing on the desolate planet. The beacon is tracked to a derelict spaceship, which Kane, Lambert and Dallas enter.  Curious and naïve, Kane wonders into a cavern of eggs. Stumbling on the slippery surface, he slips and comes into contact with the living contents of the egg.  With the parasite attached to his face, Dallas and Lambert rush Kane back to the ship. On board Ripley, who is now in command, demands that Kane be kept in quarantine for 24 hours.  Against her wishes, the odd Ash lets the three crew in.  Upon removing Kane's helmet they find a claw shaped being attached to his face.  It eventually falls off and dies and amazingly, Kane awakens, seemingly unscathed. At this stage the film remains slow and ponderous.  Intent on getting back to earth, they have one final meal before returning to hibernation.  As they eat Kane convulses violently and a creature bursts through his chest.  In utter disbelief the crew watch it skuttle away to the far reaches of the ship.From this point the film takes off.  Space and distance are enclosed as Scott uses a brilliant mix of close ups and wide angled shots to display the vastness of the Nostromo and the claustrophobia in the crew. The alien and set design are outstanding.  The massive sexual overtones of Swiss artist's H.R. Giger's alien and derelict ship are truly breathtaking, as is the futuristic-retro styling of Michael Seymour's sets.  Grubby yet cool, the production quality of ""Alien"" is something to admire. It took seven more years before a sequel was made and when James Cameron took over the directing chair he revolutionised the series by making it all out action over spooky sci-fi with ""Aliens"".  It may be a better movie, but the original remains a quality stand alone film and a landmark in the sci-fi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga."
1130,Alien,9," Milestone:The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !"
